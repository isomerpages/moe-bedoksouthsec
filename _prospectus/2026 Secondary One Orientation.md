<p>The purpose of the Secondary One Orientation is to help our new students
transition smoothly into their secondary school journey by building a sense
of belonging, confidence, and excitement for the years ahead.
<br>
<br>Through a series of carefully designed activities, students will get to
know their peers, familiarise themselves with the school environment, values,
and routines, and understand the expectations of secondary school life.
<br>
<br>This orientation aims to cultivate friendships, encourage teamwork, and
provide guidance, ensuring that each student feels welcomed and prepared
to embark on this new phase of their educational journey with a positive
and open mindset.
<br>
<br>To assist the students in making this transition, we have organised the
following:
<br>
<br><strong>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Orientation Programme: <strong>2 January 202 (Friday) and 5 January 2026 (Monday)</strong>
<br><strong>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>CCA Fair and Secondary One Parent
Engagement: <strong>9 January 2026 (Friday)</strong>
