The Dance Society has evolved over the years since its establishment in 2012. Currently, it  focuses on Chinese Dance and Wushu.

As part of the students’ experience, the Dance Society continues to participate in the bi-annual Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation. In 2019, it achieved the Certificate of Accomplishment in both the Chinese Dance and International Dance category. The Wushu team participated in the 2019 National School Games and achieved fourth place in the International Spear Event.  
  
As a performing arts group, being part of a performance is one of the ways in which students enrich their experiences. The group has performed at many school based performances such as CCA Fair, Chinese New Year Celebrations and Speech Day. In 2019, the group accepted the invitation from Siglap Community Centre to perform at the National Day Dinner, an event that was attended by members in the constituency. In 2020, a performance at Istana was scheduled on Labour day. This performance has been postponed.

  
To further enrich and enhance students’ passion in dance, learning journeys to La Salle College of the Arts and watching dance performances from professional dance groups were planned as part of the CCA experience.

As members of the society, it is important to inculcate empathy and encourage our students to actively engage with the community. The group embarked on community projects such as working with Children’s Cancer Society by helping to raise awareness of how children with cancer are coping with their illness and studies. The students also went down to the premise to help disinfect the place. Another project that is currently underway is preparing care packs for bus captains. The care pack will include some snacks and a personalized note to encourage the bus captains.

To add to the breath of the overall students’ experience in CCA, the group explored different dance moves and incorporated them in a short dance sequence to represent how people might feel in times of Covid-19.

The Dance Society will continue to strive for excellence by endeavoring to professionally train both aesthetics and technical prowess of its members, and transform them into versatile artists with charisma and stage presence.

### SYF Achievements
-----------------------------------

On April 6, the Chinese Dance Society took part in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) 2021 Dance Arts Performance (AP). With Singapore still in Phase 3 of the nation’s Re-opening plans, participation in SYF 2021 proved to be more challenging than previous years with the Safety Management Measures (SMM) in place. It was challenging for the instructor to choreograph the dance for SYF 2021 with restrictions on the maximum number of dancers per group, the need to ensure a distance of 2m between participants, and having no part of the hand or face in contact with the dance mat.

Our dance titled “2020 and me” centres around the theme of the Covid-19 pandemic. The dance aims to show the isolation and frustration faced by many people in 2020. The girls started their practice early in January this year and had more intensive training sessions during the March holidays.

The hard work and effort the girls put in truly showed their commitment and determination. The students were elated that their effort had not been in vain when they received news that Chinese Dance Society had achieved the Certificate of Distinction for their performance.
