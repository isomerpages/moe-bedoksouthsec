<p>Since 2024, together with our school community and stakeholders, our school
vision and mission have been re-imagined and minted as:</p>
<p><strong>Vision</strong>: Grateful, Gracious, and Growth-minded BDSians</p>
<p><strong>Mission</strong>: As OneBDS, we believe in the potential of every
BDSians, develop leaders of tomorrow, and serve with conviction.</p>
<p>At BDS, we believe in taking a Positive Education approach to learning.
It emphasises individual strengths, talents, and personal motivation to
promote learning. Fundamentally, we must believe that every BDSian has
potential and can contribute and achieve. BDS aspires to provide an inspiring
environment where BDSians embrace learning, discover self-directed skills,
and build strong character, preparing them for their post-secondary education
and life. Through this process, we aim to help our BDSians develop a strong
identity and gratitude for their lives as they pursue their passion through
their secondary school years.</p>
<p>We aspire for BDSians to grow as leaders of tomorrow who will serve with
conviction, and cultivate ICARE values (Integrity, Courage, Accountability,
Respect, Excellence, Care). Leadership begins with humility and the ability
to demonstrate grace, care, and respect for others; therefore, every student
can be a leader in their own way. At BDS, we educate all BDSians to be
others-centric. It is about learning to be gracious, serving, and displaying
acts of kindness to others. To this end, we envision our school to be a
community filled with meaningful connections and positive teacher-student,
and peer-to-peer relationships.</p>
<p>We live in a complex world with challenging economic conditions and geopolitical
tensions. While we cannot predict the world our children will face in the
future, we can help prepare them for it. To thrive in a world of volatility,
uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity (VUCA), students need to develop
a growth mindset and be resilient. We want BDSians to embrace challenges
without fear of failure, and to bounce back with diligence and grit to
achieve success. To do this, students need opportunities to apply their
learning and experiment, as school is the safest place to experience productive
failure.</p>
<p>I am proud and humbled to lead BDS, a school with a rich history of more
than 40 years, blessed with a conducive environment, and most importantly,
caring staff. BDS teachers are not just committed to quality learning and
character development of BDSians but also to their own professional growth.
At BDS, we are committed to learning, growing, and improving our teaching
practices and pedagogies to better engage our students. With respectful
and teachable BDSians (an endearing term we use when referring to our students),
I am confident that we can foster an inviting, caring, and supportive school
culture that develops character, ensures student well-being, and provides
enriched learning experiences through their secondary school life.</p>
<p>Together with our parents and community partners, and as OneBDS, we endeavour
to make the BDS experience a fulfilling one where we find joy in both work
and play, just as our school song declares.</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s to developing every BDSian to be Grateful, Gracious, and Growth
Minded.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Success through Endeavour.

<p>Warm regards,
<br>Mr Daryl Koh
