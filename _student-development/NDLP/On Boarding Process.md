On-Boarding Process
===================

The PLD will be used in tandem with the national e-learning platform – the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) – as well as other educational technology to personalise and enhance students’ learning. This will also enable students to acquire digital skills and apply these skills as they navigate an increasingly digitalised world.

As part of NDLP, the school has made arrangement for the purchase of personal learning device (PLD) for your child / ward.&nbsp;

Every BDSian will be using the Apple iPad as their PLD. Every iPad will come bundled with the Apple pencil and keyboard to maximise the affordances of the iPad as a learning tool.

The enhanced device bundle includes 3-year AppleCare+ for the iPad, associated accessories, two repairs or one replacement claim within the 3-year insurance/warranty period and fortnightly courier service by Contractor to collect damaged devices from school. Alternatively, parents can choose to send the iPad directly to one of the Apple Service Centres located islandwide.

### Use of Edusave

MOE has provided a one-off Edusave top-up of $200 in 2020, to all students who are Singapore Citizens. As part of the Household Support Package announced in Budget 2021, the Government will also provide a top-up of $200 in 2021 to the Edusave account of Singapore Citizens who are studying in a MOE-funded school. This is on top of the current annual contributions of $290 for secondary students. The top-up will be done automatically in May 2021.

Parents/guardians can also choose to pay cash for the PLD. However, please note that it is compulsory for all existing students on the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme to use their Edusave to pay for the PLD, after subsidies have been granted. 

To find out the balance in your Edusave account, please call 6260 0777.

### Financial Assistance

Subsidies are available for students who require financial assistance to purchase a PLD. Students under the MOE or School-based Financial Assistance Scheme for the year will automatically be subsidized for the PLD. Students who are currently not on either the MOE or School-based Financial Assistance Scheme may approach the school’s General Office to apply for subsidy if their Gross Household Income (GHI) is $4,400 or less, or Per Capita Income (PCI) is $1,100 or less.

“PCI” refers to the Gross Household Income divided by the total number of family members in the household.
