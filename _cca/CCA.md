### CCA Policy

It is compulsory for all medically fit students to take up ONE CORE CCA, which can be a Physical Sport, a Uniformed Group, a Visual and Performing Art or a Club. Students may participate in a second CCA to broaden their experiences and learn a wider range of skills.

Attendance rate is based on the main CCA and students are expected to obtain at least a 75% attendance rate. Absence from CCA is taken seriously, for which a Medical Certificate or a Letter from parents/guardians is required.

The School Band and the National Uniformed Groups (NCC, NCDCC and NPCC) are mandatory CCAs in secondary schools. Students are strongly encouraged to remain in these CCAs for the years in secondary school. One change in CCA either at the end of Secondary One or Secondary Two is allowed on a case-by-case basis.

For non-mandatory CCA, students who are keen to experience a different CCA in school may opt for a change at the beginning of each year but not during the academic year unless permission is given by the HOD / PE & CCA. In such cases, the recognition level awarded for the previous CCA will be credited to the student’s new CCA.
