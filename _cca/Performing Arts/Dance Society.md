<h1>Dance Society</h1>
<p>Welcome to the BDS Dance Society! In this CCA, you will experience the
grace and elegance of Chinese dance, while enriching your cultural knowledge,
engaging with a diverse community, and exploring creativity and innovation.
To add to that, we are a dynamic community that is passionate not only
in Chinese dance but also in other contemporary dances. We offer a supportive
environment for both beginners and seasoned dancers. Join us in this journey
of self-expression and cultural discovery, fusing tradition and modernity
in the art of dances. Using the vision of 4Es – Experience, Enrich, Engage
and Explore to plan our programmes, BDS Dance Society promises to develop
its members holistically. To allow students to explore and enhance their
passion in dance, programmes such as watching professional arts groups
performances have been planned. CCA leaders also attend the annual Ampliefied!DanceLab
organized by the Arts Education Branch. This helps them to explore their
passion in dance as they interact with other students and professionals
during this two-day course.</p>
