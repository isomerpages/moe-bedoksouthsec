Girl Guides
===========

![Girl Guides](/images/Girl-Guides.jpg)

Guiding is an international movement with over ten millions girls and young women members from 145 countries worldwide. Guiding develops girls holistically through seven developmental areas encompassing spiritual, moral, physical, mental, social, intellectual and emotional aspects. Some examples, are equipping the Guides with self-confidence, sound values, commitment and skills in service to others. All these values are nurtured using non-formal education methods, as encouraged by our World Association for Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS). Coincidentally, these aspects of Guiding coincide with the 21st century competencies and desired outcomes for students from the Ministry of Education.

We are a growing worldwide Movement – the voice of girls, and young women who influence issues they care about and build a better world.

  

### Scope of activities/Key Events/Performances


In BDS 1st Coy, we aim to nurture Guides holistically, with sound moral values and character. These are achieved through our 5-point programme, leadership opportunities and experiential learning.

  

Our Guides activities are focused on moulding young women who care and contribute to the society. We hope to nurture a Guide who is confident, determined and disciplined in what she thinks, says and does.
