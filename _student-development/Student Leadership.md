Student Leadership
==================

<b>Student Leadership Mission</b> <br>
The Student Leadership Programme in Bedok South Secondary School aims to nurture our students to be self-motivated, responsible, self-reliant, and thinking individuals who can serve and contribute effectively to society and face all challenges with courage and confidence. The committee develops student leaders through school wide programmes and through specific skills training at every level towards holistic and balanced participation. Students in Bedok South Secondary School have an opportunity to get basic leadership skills and grow as leaders. Tiered programmes are designed to develop student leaders to develop leaders of tomorrow who will serve with conviction.


<b>Student Leadership Framework</b> <br> 
The Student Leadership Framework sets a hierarchy for all Student Leaders in the School. All students undergo the Tier 1 training done during CCE lessons and Assembly Programmes. Tier 2 Leaders hold appointments and undergo training specific to their roles and responsibilities. Tier 3 Leaders hold responsibilities beyond their classrooms and CCA. They may be engaged in Student Initiated Projects that benefit the school and the community. The framework adopts the Kouzes and Posner Model for Leadership Values and builds on the schoolâ€™s ICARE values as well.
