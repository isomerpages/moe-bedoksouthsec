Principal's Message
===================

I am proud and humbled to be leading Bedok South Secondary School (BDS), a school with a rich history of 42 years and one blessed with a conducive environment and most importantly, caring staff. With respectful and teachable BDSians (an endearing term we call our students), I am most excited and privileged to build on the good work of my predecessor, Mr Teoh Teik Hoe to continue the mission to provide a caring and supportive school to develop character, ensure student well-being and having enriched learning experiences in their secondary school life.

Our BDS community is driven by our mission to ‘Build Character’ and ‘Develop Leaders of Tomorrow’ who will ‘Serve with Conviction’. To do this, fundamentally, we need to provide an engaging and motivating environment for our BDSians to enjoy learning, find joy in discovery and develop foundational skills such as self-directedness and ultimately build good character to prepare them for their post-secondary education and life. Through this process, we also want to help them form a strong identity of themselves, be grateful for what they have and find their passion as they journey through their secondary school years. I am pleased that BDS has adopted the Positive Education approach to learning which emphasises on individual strength and personal motivation to promote learning.

At Bedok South, we aspire that BDSians grow as leaders of tomorrow who will serve with conviction, and cultivate ICARE values (Integrity, Courage, Accountability, Respect, Excellence, Care). Leadership starts from humility and the ability to show grace, care and respect for others; hence, every student can be a leader in their own way. At BDS, we educate all BDSians to be people-centric. It is about learning to be gracious, serving and showing acts of kindness to others. We envision our school to be a community of meaningful connections and of positive teacher-student, peer to peer relationships. In this spirit, we will continue to strengthen Project Gratitude which was started in 2022 to imbue in all BDSians a sense of gratefulness and graciousness.

The already complex world of today was further disrupted by COVID-19. The virus has already changed our world and we must be prepared for more changes to come. On top of this, we are also entering a world with tougher economic conditions and complex geopolitical tensions. While we cannot predict what type of world our children will face in the future, we can better prepare them for it. To thrive in the VUCA world, students need to develop a growth mindset and be resilient. Our school motto: Success through Endeavour is about having that growth mindset to not be afraid of failure and to bounce back to succeed with diligence.  To do this, students need to have opportunities to apply their learning and be allowed to experiment, for school is the safest place to experience productive failure.

All these cannot be done without our committed staff and teachers. BDS teachers are not just committed to quality learning and character development of BDSians but also to professional learning. In BDS, we are committed to learn together, grow, and improve in our teaching and learning practices and pedagogies to better engage our students. In a post-COVID world, with Safe Management protocols easing and the world’s borders opening, there will be more opportunities for learning such as local and overseas learning journeys. Indeed, 2023 will be an exciting year for exploration, discovery, and learning! Together with our parents and community partners, we endeavour to make the BDS experience a fulfilling one where we find joy in both work and play.

Success through Endeavour. 

Warm regards, <br>
Mr Daryl Koh <br> 
Bedok South Secondary School
