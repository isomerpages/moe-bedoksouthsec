Applied Learning Programme (ALP) - PROJECT S.H.I.N.E 
=====================================================


### Introduction  

In our effort to provide a vibrant learner-centred environment that is conducive to student development and achievement, we have introduced the Applied Learning Programme (Project SHINE) since 2014 where students work towards a solution to a problem that addresses a genuine need in the real world. 

### Student Outcomes


The programme aims to develop:     

  

*   <b>Motivated learners with life-long values, skills and 21st century competencies</b> who are able to work in teams or independently, to experiment with ideas, explore their talent and contribute to the community. Students will see the relevance and value of what they are learning and develop in them a joy for learning and entrepreneurial spirit.   

  

*   <b>Empathetic, innovative and critical thinkers who can apply their knowledge, skills and values</b> in real-life situations. They will experience the sense of purpose and achievement that comes with productive activity. Students will seek to greater understand the needs of their target audience and to empathise with them through iterations of meaningful conversations.

  

*   <b>Effective communicators and collaborators who serve with conviction.</b>  Over time, students come to regard themselves as people who can make a difference to their own lives and in the quality of the lives of other people. Students will learn to tap on each other’s strengths and assigned varying roles in order to collaboratively work as a team among a group of diverse learners.


### Approach & Pedagogy

Project SHINE employs the Design Thinking framework, a user-centred innovation problem-finding and problem-solving process to engage in innovation projects known as Design Challenges. Project SHINE also provides opportunities for students to use Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) as a platform for problem-finding and problem-solving. Through biweekly classroom sessions with journaling on E-portfolios, learning journeys and tinkering in the ‘Xplore and Design Space, students will be equipped with the skills to identify challenges, gather information, generate potential solutions, refine ideas, test and market solutions.  

The Design Thinking framework we adopt follows the following 4 phases:

#### I) Secondary One (Experience & Expose)
--------------------------------------

<b>Theme:</b> Sustainability (Care for the environment)  
  
<b>Design challenge:</b>  <br> 
To instil a sense of care for the environment, Secondary 1 students focused on the first 2 phases of the Design Thinking cycle (Empathy and Ideation) to actively seek out problems related to issues on sustainable living as a BDSian. Students engage in workshops such as App Development and also participate in the annual National Youth Upcycling Movement to introduce a culture of sustainability through upcycling and green consumerism through upcycling tips and learning about plastic waste.

#### II) Secondary Two (Empower & Enrich)
--------------------------------------

<b>Theme:</b> Sustainability (Care for the environment)  

<b>Design Challenge:</b>  <br> 
The Design Challenge gives students the opportunity to extend the principles and mindset of Design Thinking which they have learnt in Secondary 1 to instil a sense of responsibility towards our environment and the need for conservation. Students focus on working with community partners such as the World Wide Fund for Nature while developing marketing strategies to inculcate the spirit of entrepreneurial dare.

#### III) Secondary Three
--------------------------------------

Selected students who have shown a deeper ability to apply their understanding of the Design Thinking framework in the Secondary 2 Design Challenge are selected to further explore their interest by partaking in carefully chosen national competitions. These opportunities allow students to explore and develop areas of strengths and interests as well as to better understand the post-secondary pathways, evolving job landscape and determine future career choices such as those in Science, Engineering and Technology.
