## BDS Basketball Interest Group
-----------------------------

![BDS Basketball Interest Group](/images/basketball.jpg)

The basketball interest group allows all basketball lovers in Bedok South Secondary School to come and train together. Although this is not an official Co-Curricular Activity (CCA), we meet during our free time to train as one. This interest group allows us to meet new friends from different classes and levels with a common basketball interest. Under the guidance of our basketball coach, Mr Joshua Tan, we are able to train our physical fitness and improve in our skills and techniques. We have been participating in friendly matches and at the National School Games since 2019. It has been a great learning experience to build up our team camaraderie and confidence.Â
