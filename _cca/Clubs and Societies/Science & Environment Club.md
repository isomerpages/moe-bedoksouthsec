<h1>Science &amp; Environment Club</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The Science and Environment Club nurtures students' knowledge and thinking
about scientific and environmental issues. It aims to develop students'
interest in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) and
equip them with baseline skills necessary to pursue a career in STEM.</p>
<p>The club seeks student opinions and feedback and tailors the programmes
to cater to their learning needs each year. As of May 2024, the club has

<h3>Community Involvement</h3>
<p>Students in the Executive Committee (EXCO) 2023/24 represented our school
at the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Eco-Schools Programme Awards Ceremony
2024, to receive the Eco-Schools Bronze Award as they had contributed significantly
to the Change the Way We Think About Waste project last year. They had
used the Seven Steps Approach from UNESCO's Education for Sustainable Development
framework to lead and run the following programmes that reduced the plastic
waste in our school:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Introduction to Circular Economy via Assembly Talk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making Beeswax Sandwich Wraps to Replace Plastic Bags</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learning About Plastic Waste via School-Wide Quiz</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Setup of Recycling Boxes for All Plastic Bottles in the Canteen</p>

<p>Our school was selected to be one of two schools to showcase our efforts
in changing the way that our school thinks about plastic waste. So, members
of the EXCO spent additional time and effort to prepare for the presentation
and they were most grateful for the attention from the participants at
the ceremony.</p>
<p>On 24 February 2024, representatives from the Science &amp; Environment
Club and our school’s Badminton CCA attended the East Coast Community that
was graced by the Advisers to East Coast GRC Grassroots Organisations.
The students took part in planting 100 trees to commemorate LKY100. They
also joined in the highlight event of the day – the official opening of
the Singapore Badminton Hall East Coast @ EXPO. They helped to break the
Singapore Book of Records for the most number of participants in a Badminton
rally.</p>

<h3>Achievement</h3>
<p>All Secondary 3 members of the Science and Environment Club participated
in the 25th International Elementz Fair organised by Anderson-Serangoon
Junior College as the key event in their annual 3-day S.T.E.A.M. Conference
held from 16th to 18th April 2024. Out of the three teams formed by our
club members, two team teams obtained Commendation and one team obtained
the Silver Award for their project titled Edible Candy Straws.</p>
<p>The teams of students and their respective project topics are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Project topic</strong>: Examining the amount of sugars in sodas
and fruit juices to increase the awareness of sugar intake for the public.
<br><strong>Members</strong>: LAI JUN LEONG (3C), CLIFF CHEE ZHENG RONG (3C),
NICHOLAS LAU HSIEN LI (3D), GOH ZHEN HAN RENN (3E)</p>
<p><strong>Project topic</strong>: The primary source of food wastage occurs
at the beginning of the supply chain, as farmers tend to discard imperfect
produce while selecting only the high-quality items.
<br><strong>Members</strong>: YAP CZERN SEE, LOUIS (3C), WAN JUN XI (3A),
ONG TECK WEE (3C), LOUIS LEE RUI YANG (3G)</p>
<p><strong>Project topic</strong>: Exploring the viability of candy straws
as sustainable alternative to single-use plastic bubble tea straws for
minimizing plastic waste.
<br><strong>Members</strong>: PERRY POH YAN ZHI (3D), SAMUEL LAWRENCE TAN
WEI JIE (3D) FOO CHUAN YEE (3C), and FONG KENG XIN (3D)</p>
