<h1>Information on Secondary One Subjects</h1>

secondary school student will be taking <u>up to 10 examinable subjects (depending on their posting group).</u>
</p>

<h4><strong><u>Information on Full </u><a href="#SBB" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Subject-Based Banding</a> (FSBB)</strong></h4>
<p>FSBB is part of MOE's ongoing efforts to nurture the joy of learning and
develop multiple pathways to cater to the different strengths and interests
of our students. FSBB provides students with the flexibility to offer subjects
at different subject levels and enhance their access to opportunities throughout
their educational journey.
<br>
<br>So, with FSBB, what will a Secondary One BDSian’s school experience be
like?
<br>
<br><strong>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mixed form classes at lower secondary</strong>
<br>Secondary 1 <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">students</a> will
be grouped into mixed form classes, with each form class comprising students
taking subjects at different levels. Mixed form classes present more opportunities
for students to interact with other students of different backgrounds,
<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">strengths</a>and interests.
<br><strong>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Common Curriculum Subjects</strong>
<br>In their mixed form classes, students will take a set of subjects at a
common level, amounting to about one-third of curriculum time. This would
allow students in mixed form classes to spend curriculum time together
in these subjects. Secondary One <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">students</a> from
all courses will take <u>six</u> common curriculum subjects.
<br>
<br>These subjects are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Art <em>- examinable</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Design and Technology <em>- examinable</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Food and Consumer Education <em>- examinable</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Character and Citizenship Education <em>- non-examinable</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Music <em>- non-examinable</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Physical Education <em>- non-examinable</em>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Teachers will adopt a range of teaching approaches to meet the different
learning needs and pace of their students in the same form class.</p>
<p>
<br><strong>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Offering subjects at a more demanding level at the start of Secondary One</strong>
<br>Eligible students can offer <strong>English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics and Science</strong>&nbsp;at
a more demanding level from the start of Secondary One based on students'
PSLE Achievement Level (AL) for each subject.</p>

<p>If students qualify to offer a subject at more demanding level, the school
will post the Letter of Offers through Parents Gateway. Parents may also
wish to obtain the hardcopy form at the General Office. Students and parents
have the option to either accept or decline the offer to take the subjects
at a more demanding level by <strong><u>24 December 2025</u></strong><em>.</em>
<br>
<br><strong>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Offering subjects at a more demanding level beyond the start of Secondary One</strong>
<br>Beyond the start of Secondary One (at Mid-Year and Year-End), the school
will assess students’ suitability to offer <strong>English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics and Science</strong>&nbsp;at
a more demanding level based on their performance in the specific subjects
and their aptitude.
<br>
<br>Students will also be able to offer <strong>Humanities subjects</strong>&nbsp;(Geography,
History, and Literature in English) at a more demanding level from Secondary
Two. The criteria for taking Humanities at a more demanding level will
be based on students' aptitude for and interest in these subjects at Secondary
One.</p>

<p><strong><u>Information on Mother-Tongue Languages</u></strong>
<br><strong>Higher Mother Tongue Language (HMTL)</strong>
<br>Students who obtained an AL 1/AL 2 in MTL or at least a merit in HMTL
at PSLE, would be eligible to study HMTL at secondary school.
<br>
<br>Students who have met the criteria would receive an invitation letter
to study HMTL at secondary school. The school will also be contacting you
via Parents Gateway (PG) by <strong><u>30 December 2025</u> </strong>to
liaise with you personally on the procedure on accepting the invitation.
<br>
<br>Students taking Higher Chinese Language will attend lessons at Bedok South
Secondary School during curriculum time.
<br>
<br>Students who are eligible for Higher Malay Language or Higher Tamil Language
will have to travel to one of the <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/secondary/schools-offering-full-sbb/school-specific-opportunities/language" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">designated centres</a> for
their HMTL lesson.
<br>
<br><strong>Tamil Language</strong>
</p>
<p>Bedok South Secondary does not offer Tamil Language. Students who are
taking Tamil Language will attend lessons at Bedok View Secondary School.
Registration details will be made known to students through Form Teachers
in the first week when school reopens.
<br>
<br><strong>Third Languages</strong>
</p>
<p>Please note that third languages courses provided at external centers
are over-subscribed every year. Submission of the application form at primary
school only indicates an interest to take a third language; it does not
guarantee the offer of a third language at Secondary school. MOE will inform
the outcome of application <u>via school’s Parents’ Gateway (PG) </u>by <strong>late December 2025/ early January 2026.</strong>
