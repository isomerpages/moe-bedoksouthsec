<h1>Purchase of Books, Stationeries / Socks/ PE Attire and Booklist for 2024</h1>
<p>1. All booklists are available on the school website. Refer to the booklists
<a href="https://bedoksouthsec.moe.edu.sg/information-and-links/for-students/booklists/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>2. Students are strongly advised to purchase their school items online
at <a href="https://www.pacificbookstores.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.pacificbookstores.com</a>with
option for home delivery (fixed delivery charge of $14.60 applies).
<br>
<br>Students who opt for self-collection from the school premises are strongly
advised to adhere to the <u>chosen appointment date and time.</u> We seek
your understanding that no walk-ins to purchase books on the spot will
be entertained.</p>
<p>3. If students would like to physically try the uniform sizes onsite at
the school, it is highly advisable for parents to arrange for both the
collection of books and the purchase of school uniform and tie to be within
the same timeslot/within the same day (where possible).
<br>
<br>The following dates and time are available for the walk-in and purchase
of school uniform and tie:</p>
