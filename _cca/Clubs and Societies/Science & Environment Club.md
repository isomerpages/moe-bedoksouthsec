Science &amp; Environment Club
==========================


### Overview

The Science and Environment Club nurtures students' knowledge and thinking about scientific and environmental issues. It aims to develop students' interest in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) and equip them with baseline skills necessary to pursue a career in STEM. 

The club seeks student opinions and feedback and tailors the programmes to cater to their learning needs each year. As of May 2024, the club has run the following learning modules for the students:

* Construct a Balloon Car using STEM principles
* Investigate the Oil Content in Potato Chips
* Construct a Cotton Reel Tank for the STEM Playground 2024 competition
* Plastic: Remaking Our World @ National Museum of Singapore
* Extract DNA from Strawberry
* Lecture by Science Centre: What makes a Good Science &amp; Engineering Project?
* Lecture by Science Centre: Writing a Scientific Report
* Introduction to Scientific Communication: A Peer-to-Peer Sharing of the Results from the Climate Crisis Challenge 2024 and the 25th International Elementz Fair
* The Science of Celebration: Make Candy Straw
* The Science of Celebration: Make Ice-cream
* Reflection of Learning for Semester 1
* How to Select the New Leaders
* Leadership Training
* Construct a Cardboard Chair for the STEM Playground 2024 competition
* Brain Fest 2024 @ Science Centre


<b>Students showcased the balloon car that they had made using STEM principles.</b>

 
<b>Students used their creativity and STEM principles to design ballon cars.</b>

 
<b>Students used scientific methods to investigate the oil content in potato chips.</b>

 
<b>Students conducted a workshop for their peers in school to learn STEM principles and construct a Cotton Reel Tank for the STEM Playground 2024 competition.</b>

 
<b>Students who taught their peers to make a Cotton Reel Tank for the STEM Playground 2024 competition also honed their leadership and communication skills in the process.</b>

 
<b>Students made a candy straw for drinking, in the spirit of learning the concept of ‘zero waste’ to build a more sustainable environment.</b>

 
<b>Students made ice-cream from common household ingredients and materials on the day that they celebrated the graduation of our Secondary 4 members.</b>

 
<b>Teachers and students of the Science and Environments Club celebrated the graduation of our Secondary 4 students.

 
<b>Students constructed chairs out of cardboard for the second part of the STEM Playground 2024 competition.</b>

 
<b>In a STEM session, students work in small groups with specific roles such as Contact Point, Resource Manager, Key Writer, Main Presenter, and Project Manager. They followed the Design Thinking process as well as STEM principles to make a prototype of their cardboard chair for STEM Playground 2024.</b>
