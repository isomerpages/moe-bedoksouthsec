### Appeal for School Transfer After Secondary One Posting
------------------------------------------------------

Application for Appeal to Transfer to Bedok South Secondary after Secondary One Posting 2022 is meant for Primary 6 students who have sat for the PSLE in 2021.

  

Students who have been posted to a school via DSA-Sec Exercise are NOT allowed to participate in this Appeal Exercise as they are expected to honour their commitment to the posted DSA school for the duration of the programme that they were admitted into.   

  

Admissions through the Appeal Exercise will be based on objective and transparent measures of academic merit, i.e. PSLE performance before they can be considered. Students are required to meet the school’s cut-off point before they can be considered for the transfer.   

  

Successful applicants will be notified via phone call. Hence, applicants must be reachable by phone at the local number(s) provided on the application.   

  

Application opens from 9am on 22 December 2021 to 9am on 24 December 2021 (Note that this is a projected date of application).
