<h1>NDLP</h1>
<h3>EdTech @ BDS</h3>
<p>At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National
Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools and Institutes of Higher
Learning to help students strengthen their digital literacy. One of the
components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital
Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby every
secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning
Device (PLD) by end-2021.</p>
<p>The following provides important information about how you can purchase
the PLD for your child/ward as well as the accompanying applications that
the school will be rolling out as part of the NDLP.</p>

<p>The school aims to empower every BDSian to be a positive, future-ready,
digital learner who can embrace the use of technology as a key enabler
to effectively engage in the Active Learning process, both independently
or with others; and to spark joy of learning anytime, anywhere. All students
will see themselves employing technology even more purposefully to enhance
their learning interactions, enabling them to learn actively in independent
as well as collaborative settings, both within and outside their classrooms.
Students will also acquire digital literacy in the four components of Ministry
of Education (MOE)’s Digital Literacy Framework:</p>

<h3>Roll-Out of IT Applications</h3>
<p>As part of the NDLP, schools will progressively roll out IT applications
that will be vital to students’ learning experience and educational journey.
In the following months, MOE will roll out some or all of the following
applications:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;<strong>Student iCON:</strong>&nbsp;MOE will give every secondary
school student an email address. This is a service provided by Google as
part of Google Suite. Click&nbsp;<a href="https://workspace.google.com/dashboard" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp;to access the
student iCON.</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;<strong>Microsoft Pro Plus:</strong>&nbsp;every secondary school
will be granted a licence to use Microsoft Office tools that include Word,
PowerPoint and Excel.</p>
<p>The school will need to use your child/ward’s personal data such as his/her
name and class to set up user accounts.</p>
<p>The school may also roll out applications other than those listed above.
The school will need to use your child’s/ward’s personal data such as his/her
