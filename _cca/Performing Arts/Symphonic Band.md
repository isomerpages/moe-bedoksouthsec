<p>The BDS Symphonic Band prides itself in being an energetic and passionate
group of music lovers who knows the value of cooperation and hard work
in creating beautiful music. In the capable hands of professional conductors
and tutors, students learn how to play a woodwind, brass or percussion
instrument built on a strong foundation of music theory. Regardless of
starting point, all band members will be given many opportunities to showcase
their talents and hard work through a variety of performances in school
and in the community, such as the BDS CCA Fair, Musical Escapades @ Changi
Airport in 2023 and the Kampong Chai Chee National Day Carnival in 2024,
to name a few. Furthermore, in 2025, we are excited to be invited by Esplanade-Theatres
on the Bay to take part in the Limelight series at the Esplanade Concert
Hall.</p>
<p>In line with the school motto, Success through Endeavour, BDS Symphonic
Band strives to develop its members’ musical talents through discipline
and dedication to the craft. The band aims to foster strong bonds amongst
its band members and the community while pursuing excellence in their musicality,
thus staying true to the band’s conviction - <em>In Music We Believe</em>.</p>
<h3>Vision</h3>
