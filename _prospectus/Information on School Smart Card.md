Information on School Smart Card
================================
**(STUDENT IDENTIFICATION PASS/ CONCESSIONARY TRAVEL SCHOOL SMART CARD (SSC))**

1\. Please be informed that students can continue to use their primary level School Smart Card (SSC) for concessionary travel till 30 April 2024.

2\. While waiting for their Secondary level SSC to be ready, they have the option of purchasing a Monthly Concession Pass (MCP), which is available at any TransitLink Ticket Office and Add Value Machine Plus. The MCPs can be encoded to start from any specified date up to 7 days in advance. Students will need to purchase the MCP for <u>Secondary School</u> students.

3\. For Primary School Smartcard, concession fare will be deducted during the 4 months and Secondary concession pass can be purchased.

4\. We would like to advise all Secondary 1 students to return their old Primary School Smartcard to TransitLink once they have received their new Secondary level SSC. At any point of time during the 4 months grace period, you may request for an immediate refund (if any) at any TransitLink Ticket Office or Concession Card Replacement Office. Once the 4 month period is up, studentâ€™s card will expire and cannot be used or refunded immediately. Students will then be issued a receipt and the refund can be collected after 5 working days from any TransitLink Ticket Office or Concession Card Replacement Office.

5\. The new Secondary level SSC will be issued in Feb or Mar 2024. More information will be given closer to the date.
