<h1>Information on Mother-Tongue Languages</h1>
<h3><strong>Taking MTL at a less demanding level</strong></h3>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Students who face exceptional difficulties coping
with their Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) will have the option to offer
G1 or G2 MTL. At the start of Secondary One, students can offer MTL at
a less demanding level based on the following criteria:</p>

<h3>&nbsp;<strong>Higher Mother Tongue Language (HMTL)</strong></h3>
<p>Students who belong to either the top 10% of the PSLE cohort, or the top
30% of the PSLE cohort <strong><u>and</u></strong> obtained an AL 1/AL 2
in MTL or at least a merit in HMTL at PSLE, would be eligible to study
HMTL at secondary school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Students who have met the criteria would receive an invitation letter
to study HMTL at secondary school. Mrs Ng Wan Chin [Subject Head (Covering)/Mother
Tongue Language] will also be contacting you by <strong><u>24 December 2024</u> </strong>to
liaise with you personally on the documents to submit.</p>
<p>Students taking Higher Chinese Language will attend lessons at Bedok South
Secondary School during curriculum time.</p>
<p>Students who are eligible for Higher Malay Language or Higher Tamil Language
will have to travel to one of the designed centres for their HMTL lesson.
<br>
</p>
<h3><strong>Tamil Language</strong></h3>
<p>Bedok South Secondary does not offer Tamil Language. Students who are
taking Tamil Language will attend lessons at Bedok View Secondary School.
Registration details will be made known to students through Form Teachers
in the first week when school reopens.</p>
<h3><strong>Third Languages</strong></h3>
<p>Please note that third languages are over-subscribed every year. Submission
of the application form at primary school only indicates an interest to
take a third language; it does not guarantee the offer of a third language
at Secondary school. <u>Only successful applicants will be informed via phone call</u> by
late December 2024/early January 2025. If you did not receive any phone
call from the school by this date, it means that your application for a
third language has not been successful.</p>
