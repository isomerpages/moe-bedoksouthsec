KEY PROGRAMME  :    
  
Food Science Project (SHINE): Students are given a design challenge which will focus on the authentic learning of academic subjects and health issues within the school, family and peers and designing new and safe foods for their peers. The curriculum pairs students’ work in core subjects with ‘Design Thinking’, which equips them with the skills, knowledge and attitudes needed for individual success and global competitiveness.
