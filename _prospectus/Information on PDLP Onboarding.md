<h1>Information on PDLP Onboarding</h1>
<p>Technology is an essential part of learning in today’s world. The National
Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) was launched in 2020 to make digital
learning inclusive by equipping students with the digital literacies to
be future-ready.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the NDLP, all secondary school students will own a school-prescribed
Personal Learning Device (PLD). Singapore Citizen students can use their
Edusave Account to pay for the PLD. The device will be used to facilitate
an environment that encourages personalised learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please indicate your option to purchase on the Parents’ Gateway(PG) form
by <strong><u>29 December 2025, Monday</u>. </strong>This is to ensure the
devices arrive on time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong><u>Supporting Students in the Responsible Use of the Devices</u></strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The school has in place some measures <strong>to enable a safe and seamless learning environment for students. </strong>The
role of the parent is also key in partnering the school to support your
child.&nbsp;</p>
