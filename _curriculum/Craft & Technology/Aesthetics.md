Craft & Technology
==========

 The Art, Music, Design and Technology, and Nutrition and Food Science units are the four units that make up the Craft & Technology Department.
 

We aim to develop 

* a growth-minded individual who possesses 21st century competencies and is well prepared to meet future challenges. 
* a creative youth capable of demonstrating understanding and sensitivity to the needs of others while fostering an increased appreciation for art, culinary creation, and design.
