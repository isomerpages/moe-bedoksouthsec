<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The BDS Floorball CCA started in 2008 and has grown in size and strength
since. There are now close to 90 girls and boys, representing the school
in the B and C divisions.</p>
<p>Our players train at least two or three times a week. Floorball training
follows a structured programme comprising warm-ups, stickwork, footwork,
and match play. Through these sessions, students acquire fundamental skills
and a sound understanding of the rules, while also cultivating teamwork,
communication, resilience, discipline, and leadership.”</p>
<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>A team that aims to be disciplined, fit, and focused on excellence to
achieve our best.
<br>
<br>We strive to cultivate not only athletic skills, but also strong character
and a spirit of teamwork, perseverance, and leadership. Through dedicated
training and collaborative effort, students are encouraged to uphold these
values both on and off the court, fostering personal growth.</p>
