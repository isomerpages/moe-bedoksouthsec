Social, Emotional & Moral
=========================


Our programmes support the holistic development of students  by instilling in them positive values and building their Social and Emotional Competencies. These are represented by the centre and middle rings of MOE's [Framework for 21st Century Competencies](https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/21st-century-competencies).

<i><b>Values</b></i> define a person's character. They shape the beliefs, attitudes and actions of our students. In addition to the CCE Core Values of _Respect_, _Responsibility_, _Resilience_,_Integrity_, _Care_ and _Harmony_, our programmes focus on the BDS ICARE values.

  

**_Social and Emotional Competencies_** are skills necessary for students to recognise and manage their emotions, develop care and concern for others, make responsible decisions, establish positive relations, and handle challenges effectively.


The [CCE programme and the respective guidance areas](/student-development/character-and-citizenship-education) form the baseline approach to achieve these outcomes. In addition, the following are some of the programmes that complement CCE at various levels:

* Financial Literacy Workshops (Sec 1)
* Study Skills Workshops (Sec 2)
* Myer-Briggs Type Indicator Workshops (Sec 3)
* Resume Writing and Interview Skills Workshops (Sec 4/5)
* Stress Management Workshop (Sec 4/5)
