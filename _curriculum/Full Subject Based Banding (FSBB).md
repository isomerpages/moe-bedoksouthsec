Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB)
=================================

Full SBB is part of MOE’s ongoing efforts to nurture the joy of learning and develop multiple pathways to cater to the different strengths and interests of our students.

  

With Full SBB, what will a Secondary One BDSian’s school experience be like?


### 1)     Mixed form classes at lower secondary
--------------------------------------------

Secondary 1 students will be grouped into mixed form classes, with each form class comprising students taking different courses. Mixed form classes present more opportunities for students to interact with other students taking different subject combinations, and with different strengths and interests.

### 2)     Common Curriculum Subjects
---------------------------------

In their mixed form classes, students will take a set of subjects at a common level, amounting to about one-third of curriculum time. This would allow students in mixed form classes to spend curriculum time together in these subjects. Secondary One (2023) students from all courses will take six common curriculum subjects.  

  

These subjects are:

  

*   Art - examinable
*   Character and Citizenship Education - non-examinable
*   Design and Technology - examinable
*   Food and Consumer Education - examinable
*   Music - non-examinable
*   Physical Education - non-examinable

  

Teachers will adopt a range of teaching approaches to meet the different learning needs and pace of their students in the same form class.

  

English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics, and Science will continue to be offered at Express Level, N(A) Level, and N(T) Level. The criteria for taking these subjects at a more demanding level from the start of Secondary One is based on students’ PSLE AL Score for each subject. Students will be grouped in different classes based on their subject level for each subject.

### 3)     Offering Humanities subjects at a more demanding level from Secondary 2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently, secondary school students can offer English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics and Science at a more demanding level from the start of Secondary One based on students’ PSLE Achievement Level (AL) for each subject. Beyond the start of Secondary 1, students may also offer these subjects at a more demanding level based on their performance in secondary school.

  

Our school will also provide Secondary 2 students the opportunity to take Humanities subjects at a more demanding level, if they meet subject-specific criteria. This is applicable to students who are in the Secondary 2 Normal (Academic) course from 2023, and students who are in the Normal (Technical) course from 2024.

  

The criteria for taking Humanities at a more demanding level will be based on students’ aptitude for and interest in these subjects at Secondary 1. They should also possess positive attitude towards learning and strong commitment to offer the subject at a more demanding level.
