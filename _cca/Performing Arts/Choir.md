### Our Vision

“We sing as one!”

  

In BDS Choir, students from different levels come together and bond to create new experiences in their secondary school life. Their participation in performances and various activities with the choir develop members into well-rounded youths who appreciate music in their daily lives, and provides numerous opportunities for students to grow, step up and excel in a nurturing environment. Through song, fellowship and fun, values such as leadership, resilience, responsibility and confidence are imbued in our students.
