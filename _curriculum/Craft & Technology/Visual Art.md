### Introduction
In BDS, students engage with the concepts of artists, artworks and audience. Art practice involves experiences, practical and critical thinking, conceptual and spatial inquiry and the analysis of artworks from a range of viewpoints as artists and audience. Students make individual and collaborative artworks that communicate their artistic intentions and use skills of observation, interpretation and analysis to critically evaluate their own and others’ artworks.

#### Student Outcomes
The Art Programme aims to :
* Develop a keen perception in observing and analysing visual stimuli <br>
* Cultivate an inquiring mind, a spirit of experimentation and a passion for art and design <br>
* Nurture an informed awareness and appreciation of art and design



#### Curriculum
In BDS, the general art programme is conducted throughout the year.
Students are exposed to different aspects of visual arts, including drawing, painting, sculpture, digital media and  explore a range of artistic techniques and mediums. They will also learn to apply the elements and principles of art through thoughtful art making projects each term. Students are also given opportunities to visit art museums and public art sites to provide them with real-world exposure to the art scene, making learning authentic and relevant.

Students who have an interest and demonstrated aptitude in art are encouraged to elect for the upper secondary art programme. This is a rigorous and disciplined area of study that will equip them with the requisite knowledge, skills and values to pursue higher education in art and design in their chosen career paths.

Though differentiated instruction, BDS Art programme caters to the diverse needs and abilities of students by providing choices and flexibility throughout their art making projects.
