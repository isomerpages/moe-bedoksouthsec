&nbsp;**Key points to note when driving into the school:**

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please slow down and stop promptly for students to cross at the zebra&nbsp;crossing.

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please signal early when approaching the school gate and give way to other drivers when&nbsp;necessary.

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When approaching the drop off area in the school, please stop&nbsp;at&nbsp;designated spots&nbsp;as indicated by our staff on duty. Your child should be ready to&nbsp;alight.

·&nbsp; &nbsp;When driving out of the school gate, please turn left as it will help ease the congestion and&nbsp;ensure a smooth traffic&nbsp;flow.

Please refer to the attached maps on how to get to Bedok Road and Upper East Coast Road after turning left at the school&nbsp;gate.

We thank all parents/guardians who have been understanding and we continue to seek everyone’s co-operation when driving into the school during the peak hours.
