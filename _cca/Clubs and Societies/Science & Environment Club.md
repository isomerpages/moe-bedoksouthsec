Science &amp; Environment Club
==========================


### Overview

The Science and Environment Club nurtures students' knowledge and thinking about scientific and environmental issues. It aims to develop students' interest in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) and equip them with baseline skills necessary to pursue a career in STEM. 

The club seeks student opinions and feedback and tailors the programmes to cater to their learning needs each year. As of May 2024, the club has run the following learning modules for the students:

* Construct a Balloon Car using STEM principles
* Investigate the Oil Content in Potato Chips
* Construct a Cotton Reel Tank for the STEM Playground 2024 competition
* Plastic: Remaking Our World @ National Museum of Singapore
* Extract DNA from Strawberry
* Lecture by Science Centre: What makes a Good Science &amp; Engineering Project?
* Lecture by Science Centre: Writing a Scientific Report
* Introduction to Scientific Communication: A Peer-to-Peer Sharing of the Results from the Climate Crisis Challenge 2024 and the 25th International Elementz Fair
* The Science of Celebration: Make Candy Straw
* The Science of Celebration: Make Ice-cream
* Reflection of Learning for Semester 1
* How to Select the New Leaders

### Community Involvement
Students in the Executive Committee (EXCO) 2023/24 represented our school at the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Eco-Schools Programme Awards Ceremony 2024, to receive the Eco-Schools Bronze Award as they had contributed significantly to the Change the Way We Think About Waste project last year. They had used the Seven Steps Approach from UNESCO's Education for Sustainable Development framework to lead and run the following programmes that reduced the plastic waste in our school:

* Introduction to Circular Economy via Assembly Talk
* Making Beeswax Sandwich Wraps to Replace Plastic Bags
* Learning About Plastic Waste via School-Wide Quiz
* Setup of Recycling Boxes for All Plastic Bottles in the Canteen
* Illustrate Posters to Influence the School to Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle Plastic
* School-Wide Design Thinking Competition to Generate Ideas on Reducing, Reusing, and Recycling Plastic
* Reflections and Learning on Activating Changes

Our school was selected to be one of two schools to showcase our efforts in changing the way that our school thinks about plastic waste. So, members of the EXCO spent additional time and effort to prepare for the presentation and they were most grateful for the attention from the participants at the ceremony.


On 24 February 2024, representatives from the Science &amp; Environment Club and our school’s Badminton CCA attended the East Coast Community that was graced by the Advisers to East Coast GRC Grassroots Organisations. The students took part in planting 100 trees to commemorate LKY100. They also joined in the highlight event of the day – the official opening of the Singapore Badminton Hall East Coast @ EXPO. They helped to break the Singapore Book of Records for the most number of participants in a Badminton rally.

### Achievement
All Secondary 3 members of the Science and Environment Club participated in the 25th International Elementz Fair organised by Anderson-Serangoon Junior College as the key event in their annual 3-day S.T.E.A.M. Conference held from 16th to 18th April 2024. Out of the three teams formed by our club members, two team teams obtained Commendation and one team obtained the Silver Award for their project titled Edible Candy Straws.
