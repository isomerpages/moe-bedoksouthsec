<h1>Home-Based Learning (HBL)</h1>
<h3>Overview of Home-Based Learning (HBL)&nbsp;</h3>
<p>At&nbsp;Bedok South Secondary School, we strive to provide an effective
and conducive home-based learning experience for our students. With blended
learning as a key feature of the schooling experience to further develop
self-directed, passionate and life-long learners, HBL@BDS will be conducted
every fortnight. Students will tap on the resources on the Student Learning
Space (SLS) which complements in-school activities to facilitate learning.&nbsp;&nbsp;All
Secondary 1 to 3 students are also equipped with a Personal Learning Device
(PLD) under the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) and can tap
on the various affordances provided by the PLD.</p>
<h3>HBL@BDS (every EVEN Friday)</h3>
<p>HBL@BDS will be scheduled on every EVEN Friday. Please click on the following
dates for the HBL@BDS timetable.&nbsp;<strong>All students will need to check-in with their respective Form Teachers at 7.45am on HBL@BDS days.</strong>

<h3>Student-Initiated Learning (SIL)</h3>
<p>SIL is an opportunity for you to learn to be an independent, passionate
and lifelong learner. It is a dedicated time during HBL for you to explore
personal interests, both within and outside of curriculum. From 2024, students
will begin their journey on journaling (Lower Sec) and ePortfolio creation
(Upper Sec) for SIL. Please click on the following SIL guide for the respective
levels to find out how you can go about doing your SILs.</p>
