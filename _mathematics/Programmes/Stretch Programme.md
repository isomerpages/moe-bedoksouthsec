Stretch Programme
=================

### Maths Olympiad

The Maths department actively identifies students who have a strong interest in Mathematics and Mathematical Problem Solving to provide them with greater exposure to Mathematical Problem Solving through teachers' observation during MProSE lessons and through their academic achievements.  

These students are then invited to participate in a 10 session training programme during which they are exposed to a wider range of non-routine problems and introduced to different approaches in solving these questions as well as additional content knowledge after school. Sec 1 and Sec 2 students, who are ready, are encouraged to participate in the annual Singapore Mathematics Olympiad organised by the Singapore Mathematics Society.
