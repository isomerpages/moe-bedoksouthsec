<h3>Information on Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB)</h3>
<p>FSBB is part of MOE's ongoing efforts to nurture the joy of learning and
develop multiple pathways to cater to the different strengths and interests
of our students. FSBB provides students with the flexibility to offer subjects
at different subject levels and enhance their access to opportunities throughout
their educational journey.
<br>So, with FSBB, what will a Secondary One BDSian’s school experience be
like?</p>
<p><strong>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mixed Form Classes at Lower Secondary</strong>
</p>
<p>Secondary 1 students will be grouped into mixed form classes, with each
form class comprising students taking subjects at different levels. Mixed
form classes present more opportunities for students to interact with other
students of different backgrounds,&nbsp; strengths and interests.</p>
<p><strong>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Common Curriculum Subjects</strong>
</p>
<p>In their mixed form classes, students will take a set of subjects at a
common level, amounting to about one-third of curriculum time. This would
allow students in mixed form classes to spend curriculum time together
in these subjects. Secondary One students from all courses will take <u>six</u> common
curriculum subjects.</p>
<p>These subjects are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Art <em>- examinable</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Design and Technology <em>- examinable</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Food and Consumer Education <em>- examinable</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Character and Citizenship Education <em>- non-examinable</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Music <em>- non-examinable</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Physical Education <em>- non-examinable</em>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Teachers will adopt a range of teaching approaches to meet the different
learning needs and pace of their students in the same form class.</p>
<p><strong>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Offering subjects at a more demanding level at the start of Secondary One</strong>
</p>
<p>Eligible students can offer <strong>English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics and Science</strong>&nbsp;at
a more demanding level from the start of Secondary One based on students'
PSLE Achievement Level (AL) for each subject.</p>

<p>If students qualify to offer a subject at more demanding level, the school
will post the Letter of Offers through Parents Gateway. Parents may also
wish to obtain the hardcopy form at the General Office. Students and parents
have the option to either accept or decline the offer to take the subjects
at a more demanding level by <strong><em><u>24 December 2024</u>.</em></strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Offering subjects at a more demanding level beyond the start of Secondary One</strong>
</p>
<p>Beyond the start of Secondary One (at Mid-Year and Year-End), the school
will assess students’ suitability to offer <strong>English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics and Science</strong>&nbsp;at
a more demanding level based on their performance in the specific subjects
and aptitude.</p>
<p>Students will also be able to offer <strong>Humanities subjects</strong>&nbsp;(Geography,
History, and Literature in English) at a more demanding level from Secondary
Two. The criteria for taking Humanities at a more demanding level will
be based on students' aptitude for and interest in these subjects at Secondary
One.</p>
