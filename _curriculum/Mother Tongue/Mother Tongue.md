<h1>Mother Tongue</h1>
<h3>Our Philosophy and Belief in Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Education</h3>
<p>“<em>If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his own language, that goes to his heart</em>.”
‒ Nelson Mandela</p>
<p>Bedok South’s MTL department believes that a strong foundation in MTL
is essential in giving our students a head start for the future workplace
and deepening their roots in their culture. With an increasingly globalised
workplace, it is important that our students are bilingual and be able
to work well in teams of different ethnicities and nationalities. Being
able to work well goes beyond just being able to speak the language. It
also means having a deep understanding of one’s culture and an inclusive
mindset to forge a mutual understanding of each other’s cultures and practices.</p>
<p>Through interactive, authentic and meaningful learning experiences, we
aim to nurture our students to be confident communicators of their MTLs,
rooted to their culture, open to the world.</p>
<h3>The BDS Experience</h3>

<p>Mother Tongue Fortnight 2023</p>
<p>In support of MOE's efforts to promote student learning and appreciation
of Mother Tongue Languages and cultures, our BDS MT Department has organized
our Mother Tongue Fortnight (MTFN) in Term 2 Week 2 and Week 3 (27 March
– 6 April 2023). Our students participated in various fun and meaningful
activities within and outside curriculum time to encourage them to use
their MTL and deepen their sense of belonging and rootedness.</p>

<p>MTL Tongue Talent Management Program 2023</p>
<p>As part of our BDS Mother Tongue Talent Development programme, selected
students who display interest and aptitude in learning Mother Tongue are
given opportunities to participate in activities with authentic settings.
These exposures deepen the learning of Mother Tongue Language and provide
students with stronger greater understanding and appreciation of their
cultural roots. As shown in the photo above, as part of our Mother Tongue
Fortnight activities, our Sec 3 Higher Chinese students went through the
Student Docent Training program (Photo 1) and facilitated the learning
journey of their Sec 3 school peers when they visited Sun Yat Sen Nanyang
Memorial Hall (Photo 2) in March.</p>

<h3>Parents' Corner</h3>
<p><strong>Supporting your child in learning and loving his/her MTL, is as easy as A, B, C.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br><strong>Active partnership with the school</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Your child will set a clear goal for assessments in consultation with
his/her MTL teacher. Regular check-ins and encouragement from parents will
motivate your child to stay on track.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On-going communication with teachers ensures you remain updated on your
child’s progress. Besides scheduled Parent-Teacher Meetings, do drop your
child’s MTL teachers an email if you require additional information regarding
your child’s learning of MTL.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br><strong>Balanced approach in home-support</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>As MTL is an examinable subject, it is natural for parents to feel anxious
if your child has not yet achieved his/her targets. It is important to
build up the frequency of language exposure at home, at the same time,
ensure your child continues to feel supported and motivated to learn MTL
to the best of his/her ability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are some home routines and expectations you may wish to have in
place, when your child spends his/her time at home, some examples include:
<br>(a) Carve out time to read books / articles in MTL
<br>(b) Tune in to the respective TV channels to listen to news updates in
MTL
<br>(c) Download a dictionary app in your child’s and/or your own mobile phone
to expand your child’s vocabulary knowledge.
<br>(d) Encourage your child to make conscious efforts to speak in complete
sentences, using his/her MTL. This would greatly help in language acquisition
and build your child’s confidence in using the language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here are some other tips to provide the supportive and balanced environment
for your child to learn MTL with joy:
<br>(a) Celebrate your community’s festivals and learn about the culture,
traditions and practices related to them. This will allow your child to
gain knowledge and awareness of his/her own cultural roots and be proud
of their own identity.
<br>(b) Allow your child to indulge in watching their favourite or chosen
TV programmes in MTL at appropriate timings, if the programmes are meaningful
and if he/she shows keen interest in watching them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br><strong>Celebrate every little progress and success </strong>
<br>* Be the ever-supportive cheer leader of your child. Learning a language
is never easy and it will always be a work-in-progress. When your child
makes progress, be generous in your affirmation and motivate them to strive
for constant improvement.</p>
<p>
<br>There are no last-minute study tips when it comes to learning a language.
The key to ensuring positive learning outcomes is consistency of language
exposure and a supportive home environment for language development. With
a strong partnership between school and parents, your child will experience
the joy of learning MTL.</p>
