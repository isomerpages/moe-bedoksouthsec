Information on PDLP Onboarding
==============================

Digital technology is becoming increasingly pervasive in jobs, workplaces and society. The National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) was launched in March 2020 to make digital learning inclusive by equipping students with the digital literacies to be future-ready. 

Through the NDLP, all secondary school students will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD). Singapore Citizen students can use their Edusave Account to pay for the PLD. The device will be used to facilitate an environment that encourages personalised learning.

#### **Implementation @ BDS** 
<b>Timeline</b>: Delivery of personal learning devices by April/May
<br><b>Device</b>: Apple iPad 
<br><b>Storage in school available</b>: Lockers 
<br><b>Platforms/ tools</b>: Student Learning Space (SLS) as primary platform, complemented by a host of other apps and tools that the school has an overview of (some of which may be subject-specific)


#### **Funding Support for Singapore Citizen (SC) Students**

**The cost of the device bundle can be paid using your childâ€™s Edusave account,** after setting aside provision for payment of second-tier miscellaneous fees. 
<br><br>For students on MOE-FAS, subsidies are available even if there is insufficient Edusave balance. The cash out-of-pocket will be $0.

#### **Funding Support for Non-Singapore Citizen Students**

Financial assistance is also available for Permanent Residents (PR) and International Sstudents (IS) who need support. 


#### **Supporting Students in the Responsible Use of the Devices**

The school has in place some measures **to enable a safe and seamless learning environment for students.** The role of the parent is also key in partnering the school to support your child.
