### Overview of Home-Based Learning (HBL) 

At Bedok South Secondary School, we strive to provide an effective and conducive home-based learning experience for our students. With blended learning as a key feature of the schooling experience to further develop self-directed, passionate and life-long learners, HBL@BDS will be conducted every fortnight. Students will tap on the resources on the Student Learning Space (SLS) which complements in-school activities to facilitate learning.  All Secondary 1 to 3 students are also equipped with a Personal Learning Device (PLD) under the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) and can tap on the various affordances provided by the PLD.

### HBL@BDS (every EVEN Friday)

HBL@BDS will be scheduled on every EVEN Friday. Please click on the following dates for the HBL@BDS timetable. <b>All students will need to check-in with their respective Form Teachers at 7.45am on HBL@BDS days.</b>
