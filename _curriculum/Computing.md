<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The rapid advancement of technology and growing capabilities of Artificial
Intelligence (AI) will bring about significant changes to the way we learn,
work and play. Companies must embrace digital transformations to survive
and strive and individuals must learn new digital skills to remain relevant.
Computing subjects provide upstream support for this effort by providing
students with opportunities to acquire useful digital competencies and
explore the field of Computing.</p>
<h3>Student Outcomes</h3>
<p>Through the G1 Computing subject, our students
<br>• develop basic computational thinking skills along with 21st century
competencies,
<br>• develop digital competencies in using digital tools to create digital
artefacts, process information, communicate effectively and solve simple
problems,
<br>• appreciate the legal, ethical and security issues relating to the use
of computers, and
<br>• gain understanding of emerging technologies and the impact of technology
on society.</p>
<h3>Pedagogy Approaches</h3>
<p>The central pedagogical approaches adopted for CPA are the ‘learning through
doing’ and ‘problem-driven’ approaches.</p>

<h3>Achievements</h3>
<p>Bedok South’s CPA team has proudly participated in the annual Animation
and Game Making (AGM) competition organised by Curriculum Planning and
Development Division (CPDD) for over a decade. All Secondary 3 Computing
students can participate in this competition and design a game using the
block-based coding programme.</p>
<p>In 2025, the Secondary 3 category tackled a crucial topic: "Artificial
Intelligence (AI) and Us." Students channelled their creativity to design
an engaging game that serves as a vital guide, teaching loved ones how
to interact with AI safely and secure their digital lives in a world of
smart technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's celebrate Sim Zhao Zhi (3 Gratitude)! Your dedication to this essential
theme has earned you a well-deserved Certificate of Participation in the
competition!</p>

<p>For 2024, the Secondary 2 category requires students to create a short
animation to raise awareness of the "I Can ACT against Scams" campaign.
For the Secondary 3 category, students code to create a game that promotes
Intergenerational Harmony that encourages positive interaction between
the young and the old.</p>
<p>We are proud of Muhammad Sulaiman from 2 Gratitude and Lee Soon Fu from
3G for attaining the Silver award in the competition. Congratulations!</p>
