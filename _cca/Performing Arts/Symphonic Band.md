The BDS Symphonic Band prides itself in being an energetic and passionate group of music lovers who know the values of cooperation and hard work in creating beautiful music. In the capable hands of professional conductors and tutors, students learn how to play a woodwind, brass or percussion instrument built on a strong foundation of music theory. Regardless of starting point, all band members will be given many opportunities to showcase their talents and hard work through a variety of performances.  

  

In both school and the community, BDS Symphonic Band has participated in a myriad of events such as the BDS CCA Fair and the Family Day@Siglap CC. Beyond music making, the band finds it important to contribute back to the community and have taken on VIA projects working with the different facets of the community, like the elderly in 2019 and transport workers in 2020.

  

In line with the school motto, _Success through Endeavour_, BDS Symphonic Band strive to develop its members' musical talents through discipline and dedication to the craft. The band aims to foster strong bonds amongst its band members and the community while pursuing excellence in their musicality, thus staying true to the band's conviction - _In Music, We Believe_.

### SYF Achievements
-----------------------------------

The BDS Symphonic Band participated in the 2021 SYF Arts Presentation in the Band (Flexible Band) category. Due to Covid-19, the configuration of the band had to be adjusted to fit the safe management measures. As such, we had to rearrange our members into two smaller teams. Team A performed Acclamations by Ed Huckeby and Team B performed Terracotta Warriors by Scott Watson at the Singapore Conference Hall in April this year. We are proud to announce that Team A and B have done us proud, and have achieved the Certificate of Distinction and the Certificate of Accomplishment respectively. Well done to both bands, and in music we believe!
