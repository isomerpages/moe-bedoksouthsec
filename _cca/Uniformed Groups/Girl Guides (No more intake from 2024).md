<p>Guiding is an international movement with over ten millions girls and
young women members from 145 countries worldwide. Guiding develops girls
holistically through seven developmental areas encompassing spiritual,
moral, physical, mental, social, intellectual and emotional aspects. Some
examples, are equipping the Guides with self-confidence, sound values,
commitment and skills in service to others. All these values are nurtured
using non-formal education methods, as encouraged by our World Association
for Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS). Coincidentally, these aspects
of Guiding coincide with the 21st century competencies and desired outcomes
for students from the Ministry of Education.</p>

<h3>Scope of activities/Key Events/Performances</h3>
<p>In BDS 1st Coy, we aim to nurture Guides holistically, with sound moral
values and character. These are achieved through our 5-point programme,
leadership opportunities and experiential learning.</p>
<p>Our Guides activities are focused on moulding young women who care and
contribute to the society. We hope to nurture a Guide who is confident,
determined and disciplined in what she thinks, says and does.</p>
