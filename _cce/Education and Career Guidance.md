The Educational & Career Guidance programme aims to equip students with the needed knowledge, skills and attitudes to enable them to constantly cope with change, adapt to new situations and make informed education and career choices. This is to prepare our students for the world of work, equip them with the skills to remain competitive in the global economy and above all, to lead meaningful and productive lives.
