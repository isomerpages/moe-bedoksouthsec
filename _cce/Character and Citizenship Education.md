Character and Citizenship Education  
=====================================

### Introduction

Bedok South Secondary takes a whole school approach towards Student Development with every teacher, a Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) teacher. The school aims to develop our students’ knowledge, understanding, skills and abilities to make informed and responsible choices in their lives. CCE seeks to achieve the BDS vision to:

* Build Character 
* Develop Leaders of Tomorrow; so that BDSians will 
* Serve with Conviction 

Our curriculum is aligned to the [MOE Framework for 21st Century Competencies and Student Outcomes](https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/21st-century-competencies)  and the [MOE CCE Syllabus for secondary schools](/files/2021%20Character%20and%20Citizenship%20Education%20Syllabus-Secondary.pdf).

### Student Outcomes

* a confident person who has a strong sense of right and wrong, is adaptable and resilient, knows himself, is discerning in judgment, thinks independently and critically, and communicates effectively.
* a self-directed learner who questions, reflects, perseveres and takes responsibility for his own learning.
* an active contributor who is able to work effectively in teams, is innovative, exercises initiative, takes calculated risks and strives for excellence.
* a concerned citizen who is rooted to Singapore, has a strong sense of civic responsibility, is informed about Singapore and the world, and takes an active part in bettering the lives of others around him.

### Approach and Pedagogy

The BDS CCE experience comprises the following areas: 

##### **CCE Lessons**

CCE lessons are opport unities for teachers to facilitate learning for building positive character and citizenry. The lessons across all levels (secondary 1 to 5) are taught according to the following themes

*  The Leader Within 
*  Family Our Foundation
*  Being a Positive Influence 
* U & I in the Community 
*  This is Home Truly   
* Thinking Hearts, Feeling Minds

To develop social and emotional competencies in students, the following programmes are incorporated into CCE lessons:

* Education and Career Guidance 
* Sexuality Education 
* Cyber Wellness 
* Values in Action

CCE lessons are also a platform to deliver the National Education (NE) experience.

##### **School-Based CCE**

To enhance the development of positive character and values, morning assemblies are platforms for talks and sharing by staff and students. Three times a week, presentations during morning assemblies focus on the following themes:

* <i>Values Monday</i> : Staff and students link the BDS ICARE Values to stories, articles and their personal experiences to inculcate in students the values of Integrity, Courage, Accountability, Respect, Excellence and Care. 
* <i>CCE Wednesday</i> : Sharing by staff and students on Character and Citizenship Education
* <i>Excellence Friday</i> : To encourage students to strive for excellence in all they do, student achievements are recognised and students are given the opportunity to share their learning on their journey to success. 

In addition, customised assembly programmes are planned throughout the year to compliment the lessons taught during CCE lessons.

**Teacher-Pupil Interviews**

Form Teachers conduct Teacher-Pupil Interview (TPI) sessions with students to build rapport and identify their needs and strengths. Students are encouraged to take this opportunity to get to know their Form Teachers better and share with them their concerns and aspirations. TPI sessions are conducted during dedicated curriculum time.

**Student Recognition**

The [EdusaveCharacter Award (ECHA)](https://www.moe.gov.sg/education/edusave/edusave-awards/edusave-character-awards-(echa)) **(broken link)** aims to recognise Singaporean students in the school who are exemplary in character and possess outstanding personal qualities through their behaviour and actions which inspire others. This award is given to a maximum of 2% of Singaporean students in the school at the end of the year. 

ECHA recipients are selected based on school-based criteria that are based on guidelines provided by MOE. Students are identified for consistently demonstrating civic responsibility, resilience and values that BDS wishes to recognise and encourage.
