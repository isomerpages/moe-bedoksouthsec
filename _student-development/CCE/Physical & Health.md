Level Camps for "Grow Week"
===========================

BDS embarked on a coordinated&nbsp;school-wide programme where all levels went&nbsp;through 3 days of camp throughout Singapore in&nbsp;the second week of Term 1 from 13-15 Jan. The&nbsp;Sec 1s had Camp Unity which was an orientation&nbsp;camp while the Sec 2s had Camp Challenge, an adventure camp at Jalan Bahtera Outdoor Adventure Learning Centre. As for the Sec 3s, they had&nbsp;Camp Endeavour with expeditions taking them to&nbsp;various parts of the island. The Sec 4s and 5s had&nbsp;‘Camp Success’ which was a personal development&nbsp;programme to prepare for their national examinations ahead.

 <b>Sec 1 Camp Unity:</b>
 <br>Camp Unity was a 3-day 2-night residential camp&nbsp;programme conducted in school. About 275 Sec 1&nbsp;students attended this camp along with 30 Sec 2&nbsp;prefects and peer leaders who helped to organise&nbsp;the camp. Their form teachers stayed with them&nbsp;throughout the camp, strengthening bonds with&nbsp;their form classes. Students participated in activities that developed their class spirit and identity.&nbsp;The highlight of the camp was the campfire where&nbsp;a huge screen was constructed at the quadrangle&nbsp;displaying the amazing campfire.
 

<b>Sec 2 Camp Challenge:</b>
<br>Camp Resilience was conducted at Jalan Bahtera&nbsp;located at the western end of Singapore. There&nbsp;they participated in adventure activities like abseiling, high and low ropes courses, caving and an&nbsp;expedition to Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve. The&nbsp;students were placed outside their comfort zone&nbsp;and they had to overcome the individual and group&nbsp;challenges placed before them. They were led also&nbsp;by Sec 3 prefects and peer leaders in the activities.

  

<b>Sec 3 Camp Endeavour:</b>
<br>Camp Endeavour was a series of three expeditions.&nbsp;The first was a 8km long orienteering trail at Pasir&nbsp;Ris Park. Students get to practise their navigation&nbsp;skills. The second was a 11km trail around&nbsp;MacRitchie Reservoir where the students navigated themselves around the Nature Reserve of&nbsp;MacRitchie Reservoir, the Central Catchment Area&nbsp;and the Tree Top Walk. The third expedition was&nbsp;the Southern Ridges Trail which was about 12km&nbsp;long. There they walked up and down Telok Blangah Hill, Mt Faber and crossed the beautiful Henderson Waves Bridge ending the hike at HortPark.

  

<b>Sec 4 Camp Success:</b>
<br>
Camp Success had the Sec 4s and 5s undergoing&nbsp;training sessions to develop their time management skills and life skills needed to chart their&nbsp;future. They had courses in resume writing and&nbsp;interview skills to help prepare them for their&nbsp;future. They also had sessions where they discover&nbsp;and explore their future education and careers.

Overall the camps marked a good start for each of&nbsp;the levels. These set a good tone and signalled a&nbsp;good start for the year ahead for all.
