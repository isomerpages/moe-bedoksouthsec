Open House
==========

Bedok South Secondary School is hosting an Open House to welcome prospective parents and students who wish to visit our campus and learn more about what we have to offer.  

This upcoming Open House will be a great opportunity for prospective parents and students to interact with our staff and students to explore secondary school life at our school.Â   

We hope that you will have an enjoyable experience exploring our school and we look forward to having you join us at our Open House on 25 November 2023!
