<h1>Scouts</h1>
<p>The Scout Movement is an integral partner that helps its members build
character and leadership. Scouting offers an informal education to develop
individuals for purposeful and responsible adulthood. The Scout Method
is a comprehensive framework composed of key elements that work together
as a system to provide young people with a rich and active learning environment,
taking account of their evolving characteristics, needs and interests at
different stages.</p>

<h3>Mission of Scouting</h3>
<p>The mission of Scouting is to contribute to the education of young people,
through a value system based on the Scout Promise and Law, to help build
a better world where people are self-fulfilled as individuals and play
a constructive role in society. This objective is achieved by:
<br>• involving them throughout their formative years in a non-formal educational
process
<br>• using a specific method that makes each individual the principal agent
of his or her development as a self-reliant, supportive, responsible and
committed person
<br>• assisting them to establish a value system based upon spiritual, social
and personal principles as expressed in the Promise and Law</p>
<h3>Vision of Scouting</h3>
<p>Better Scouting for more Young People</p>
<h3>The Scout Promise</h3>
<p>On my Honour, I promise that I will do my best
<br>To do my duty to God and to the Republic of Singapore
<br>To help other people and
<br>To keep the Scout Law</p>
<h3>The Scout Law</h3>
<p>A Scout is to be trusted
<br>A Scout is loyal
<br>A Scout makes friends, establishes and maintains harmonious relations
<br>A Scout is disciplined and considerate
<br>A Scout has courage in all difficulties</p>
<h3>Kijang Scout Group</h3>
<p>“Try and leave this world a little better than you found it, and when
your turn comes to die, you can die happy in feeling that at any rate,
you have not wasted your time but have done your best.” – Robert Baden-Powell,
the founder of the Scout movement.</p>
<p>
<br>It is our aspiration that the life skills that we impart will prepare
our Scouts for the future and to become useful individuals to society.
The quest for continuous learning is apparent in Kijang Scout Group as
our youths expand their knowledge through a wide range of programmes each
year. One of the highlights involved East Area Scout Leadership Course
(SLC) 2024, whereby our cadets from Secondary Two and Three honed their
leadership qualities and styles through a range of stimulating activities
at the Sarimbun Scout Camp. Our Scouts treasured the bonds that were forged
with members of various troops in the region.</p>
<p>
<br>The Diamond Jubilee Challenge (DJC) first introduced by our former Chief
Scout, President Halimah Yacob, was into its third year in 2024. The main
purpose of the DJC is to help our Scouts learn about the United Nations’
Sustainable Development Goals, discover their place in the community, and
what it means to be a Singaporean, as well as contribute towards “Creating
a Better World”. The theme of DJC 2024 is Skills for Life, whereby our
youths acquire skills relevant to their personal development through meaningful
learning journeys and community engagement activities.</p>
<p>
<br>In addition, our Scouts participated in Adiji Chief Scout 2024 at Choa
Chu Kang Stadium. The official event was launched to welcome our new Chief
Scout, President Tharman Shanmugaratnam. Approximately 3,000 youths gathered
and celebrated the joyous occasion, as well as to commemorate Founder’s
Day. Thrilling activities such as exhibits of core Scouting skills and
carnivals were available to engage Scouts from various sections. Our youths
were distinctly exhilarated as President Tharman Shanmugaratnam visited
their booth. Our Scouts gained fruitful and memorable insights as they
demonstrated their sense of teamwork and unity throughout the process.</p>
<p>
<br>Job Week 2024 was an educational experience, whereby our Scouts undertook
to approach friends and neighbours around their communities for donations
through a variety of tasks. The main purpose of the Job Week is to inculcate
in our youths the dignity of labour, the value of integrity and to help
others, which will enable them to become confident citizens with strong
communication and collaboration skills. The concept of service before self;
service to the community and the nation is an important aspect of the Scout
Programme. Our Scouts performed jobs such as cleaning the corridor, taking
away food, sorting out recyclables and watering the plants, which assisted
them to appreciate the relentless efforts of our frontline workers such
as town council cleaners and food delivery riders.</p>
<p>
<br>Created in 1995 and named in honour of the father of Scouting in Singapore,
the Frank Cooper Sands Award (FCSA) is presented annually to units for
their exceptional performance. The assessment and award structures were
simplified with effect from Year of Assessment 2023 (YA2023) in tandem
with broad changes in the educational landscape and societal contexts of
Scouts from various sections. Quantitative modes of ranking through the
existing Gold, Silver and Bronze Awards were removed to place emphasis
on the quality development of our youths. The Senior Patrol Leaders played
their integral roles steadfastly in enabling our troop to attain the FCSA
for YA2023. Equipped with a solid platform for its pursuit of excellence,
Kijang Scout Group will strive to groom the next batch of tenderfoots in
the true spirit of Scouting.</p>
