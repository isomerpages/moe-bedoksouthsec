School Leaders' Message
=======================

### Welcome


A very warm welcome to all BDSians, including our new addition, our Sec 1 students. We are happy that you have chosen to join us and believe that, with the support and guidance of all BDSians, you would be able to transit smoothly and thrive in your new environment.



### Looking Forward

Despite COVID-19 throwing a spanner to all our plans for the past two years, we have risen above and have much to look forward to. We have embarked on Home-Based Learning (HBL) since end 2020 and will continue to do so this year. HBL has helped BDSians develop the mind-sets and habits for self-directed learning, an important 21CC competency. We hope that this would build your self-confidence, independence, motivation, enthusiasm and develop the correct learning dispositions to learn for life.  

In the new normal, it is imperative that we ensure that you would be able to face the world’s predictable unpredictability. Hence, at BDS, character development and your well-being continue to take centre-stage. We have adopted Martin Seligman’s Positive Education approach which emphasizes on individual strength and personal motivation to promote learning.  Focusing on positive education, positive engagement, positive relationships, positive meaning, positive accomplishments and positive health, we aim to ensure that you enjoy coming to school, are engage in learning and are motivated to give your best. In other words, we want you to have a positive school experience.

An aspect of Positive Education is Gratitude. This year, we have embarked on Project Gratitude which is a whole school approach to imbue a sense of gratefulness and appreciation in all BDSians. It is rooted in the ICARE values of Integrity, Courage, Accountability, Respect, Excellence and Care. With a Culture of Gratitude in school, we hope to achieve even better positive Teacher-Student Relationship, healthy peer relationships and a sense of belonging to the school.    

Climate change is a global challenge and we need to do our part to build a sustainable future. At BDS, we will embark on an exciting initiative on Sustainability where students and staff will be empowered to take responsibility and constructive action to pursue sustainable living inside and outside of school. This is very much aligned to Singapore’s Green Plan 2030 where we moved towards sustainable development.

This year will be an exciting year and we hope that 2022 will be kind to all BDSians. Let us continue to support and encourage one another. Let us work together and be united so that we will be stronger and better.  

Warm regards, <br>
School Leaders <br>
