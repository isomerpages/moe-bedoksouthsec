<h1>Online Consent for Dental Services</h1>
<p>To promote good oral health for the students, the Health Promotion Board
(HPB) continues to provide free dental checks and basic dental treatments
(if required) at specified times during school hours in secondary schools.</p>
<p>Parents must give their consent before their child can receive such services.</p>
<p>To make it more convenient and secure, HPB has launched the Child Consent
Portal since 2016 for parents to submit your consent online. It only takes
four steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Log on to <a href="https://consent.hpb.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://consent.hpb.gov.sg/</a> to
access the child consent portal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Login using your Singpass with 2-factor authentication (2FA). (You may
register for Singpass by visiting&nbsp;<a href="https://www.singpass.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.singpass.gov.sg</a>&nbsp;OR
any Singpass counter. The location of Singpass counters and instructions
for 2FA activation are available on&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.singpass.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.singpass.gov.sg</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type in your child's UIN/ BC/ FIN number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fill up and submit the consent form.
<br>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>HPB receives enrolment information progressively in batches. Should you
be prompted at step 3 that HPB has not received your child’s/ ward’s enrolment
information, please provide your email address via the portal. You will
be notified via email once HPB receives your child’s/ ward’s enrolment
information.</p>
