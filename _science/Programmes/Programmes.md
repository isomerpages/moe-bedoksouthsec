On 16 and 17 May 2018, the Sec 1 Express and N(A) students participated in the Learning Journey to the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum at the National University of Singapore. During the visit, the students viewed specimens of many organisms including large varieties of insects, sea creatures and mammals, some of which are native to Singapore. The students then worked collaboratively to construct a dichotomous key which allowed them to develop an appreciation of how scientists actually work to classify organisms. 


They also came up close and personal with the museum’s three dinosaur skeletons excavated from America and “Jubi Lee”, the skeleton of the first sperm whale found in Singapore waters during Singapore’s Jubilee year. Through viewing of the sperm whale exhibit which showed the contents salvaged from the gut of the whale, they were also able to reflect on the impact of human activities on biodiversity and what actions they can take to preserve our natural heritage.
