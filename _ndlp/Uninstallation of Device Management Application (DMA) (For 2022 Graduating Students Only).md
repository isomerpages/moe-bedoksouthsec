Uninstallation of Device Management Application (DMA) \[For 2022 Graduating Students Only\]
===========================================================================================


### Information for 2022 Graduating Students for DMA Uninstallation from Personal Learning Device (PLD)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Device Management Application (DMA), Mobile Guardian, will be uninstalled from all 2022 Graduating Students only with effect from the following dates:  
  

*   <b>Secondary 4 Express: 15 November 2022</b>
*   <b>Secondary 4 Normal: 30 December 2022</b> 
     *   Click [here](/files/Briefing%20for%20Uninstalling%20DMA%20from%20PLD%20For%204N%20Students.pdf) for briefing slides.

  

After the DMA uninstallation, you will be able to use the PLD without the DMA. The browsing activity and browsing history will no longer be monitored and will be deleted from the DMA server.

<u><b>2\. Actions required by Graduating Students</b></u>

*   <b>Before the uninstallation:</b> Ensure that all data on your PLD have been backed-up (e.g. saved on an <i><b>external storage device</b></i> or to a <i><b>personal cloud storage</b></i>). This will prevent any loss of important data when the factory reset is performed.

  

*   <b>On the day of uninstallation (30 December 2022):</b> Ensure that the PLD is <u><b>switched on and connected to the internet from 6.00 AM to 11.00 PM</b></u>, and refrain from using the PLD during that period. This is to ensure that the uninstallation process, which is done remotely, can proceed smoothly.

  

*   <b>After the uninstallation</b>: Click [here](/files/Instructions%20for%20DMA%20Uninstallation.pdf) for the guide to check if the DMA has been successfully uninstalled.
