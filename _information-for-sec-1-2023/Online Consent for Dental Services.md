Online Consent for Dental Services
==================================

To promote good oral health for the students, the Health Promotion Board (HPB) continues to provide free dental checks and basic dental treatments (if required) at specified times during school hours in secondary schools.

  

Parents must give their consent before their child can receive such services.

  

To make it more convenient and secure, HPB have launched the Child Consent Portal since 2016 for parents to submit your consent online. It only takes four steps:

  

 1. Log on to [https://childconsent.hpb.gov.sg](https://childconsent.hpb.gov.sg/) or scan the QR code below to access the child consent portal.
