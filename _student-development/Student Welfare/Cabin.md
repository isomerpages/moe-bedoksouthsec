Cabin
===========

The Cabin is a safe environment for students to hang out after school hours to enjoy facilities such as gaming consoles and board games, or engage in meaningful activities. A youth worker is present to reach out to youth through organised fun-filled activities such as competitions, life skills workshops and provide counselling support for students in need. The Cabin is open on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1.45 pm to 4.45 pm.
