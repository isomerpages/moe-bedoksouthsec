<h1>Reporting Time on First Day of School<br>(2 Jan 2026, Friday, 9:00 a.m.)</h1>
<p>Secondary One students’ <strong>reporting/flag-raising time for Day 1 (2 Jan 2026) is 9:00 a.m</strong>.
Students are advised to report to school <strong><u>by 8:50 a.m.</u></strong> so
that they have ample time to make their way to the <strong><u>Indoor Sports Hall (ISH)</u></strong> within
the school. There will be Student Leaders on standby to chaperone the students
to the ISH on the first day of school. Please note that there is no scheduled
programme for parents/guardians on Day 1. Parents/guardians <u>will not be required</u> to
accompany their child/ward.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>From Day 2 (Monday, 5 Jan 2026) onwards, Secondary One students will follow the normal reporting/flag-raising time for school which is 7:45 a.m.</strong> Students
are advised to report to school <strong><u>by 7:30 a.m.</u></strong> so that
they have time to make their way to the <strong><u>ISH</u></strong>. <u>Students who arrive at ISH after 7:45 a.m. will be considered late for school.</u>
</p>
<p><strong>While waiting for the flag-raising to commence at 7:45 a.m., students are required to bring along a book/approved reading materials for silent reading.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Note: On all Thursdays, the school operates on a late-reporting schedule.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Flag-raising will begin at 8:45 a.m., and students are advised to report to school by 8:30 a.m.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong><u>For the following week,</u></strong>  <strong>students are to take note of the reporting venues for the different days:</strong>
