### Tips for Parents

<b>Setting a clear goal and work towards it</b>

Your child will be sitting for the MTL exam in May/June before he/she sits for the papers of all remaining subjects in October and November. If your child is able to do well for the MTL paper in May/June, your child will have one less subject to focus on— and worry about— in the second half of the year. Your child can then have more time, both during and after school hours, to study other subjects. Doing well for the first ‘O’ Level exam and securing a distinction would also boost your child’s morale and build the momentum towards getting more good grades at the end of the year. It is thus crucial to encourage your child to give his/her all to achieve the best possible grade for the first MTL paper.  
  
Ask your child to think of the MTL grade that he/she would want to achieve and ensure he/she work towards it now.

<b>Focus on becoming a confident speaker</b> 

Encourage your child to seize every opportunity to converse in his/her MTL, particularly for students who are from an English speaking background. Conversing in Mother Tongue Language on a daily basis will help your child build confidence over time and aids in the expression of ideas your child may have in his/her mind without having to translate consciously from the English language. Becoming a competent speaker will reap huge potential benefits considering the oral component alone makes up 25% of the assessment weighting in ‘O’ level exam. In other words, if your child speaks well in his/her MTL, your child is definitely in a much better position to do well and excel in the subject.

<b>Increase Frequency of Language Usage and Exposure</b>

Intensity of language learning and frequency of language usage are two important keys to becoming proficient and competent in a language. Just relying on three to four MTL lessons (which is barely four hours) per week in school may not be sufficient to help your child secure his/her desired grade. Your child will have to help himself/herself by committing to learning the language outside curriculum hours. The following strategies should yield tangible results in a few months’ time if they are strictly adhered to in a consistent manner:  
  
<b>1\. Cultivate a reading habit.</b>If your child is not able to read a book, do ensure he/she reads at least two essays and two comprehension passages every day. Have your child highlight the words and phrases which they think may be useful when writing essays.  
  
<b>2\. Listen to half an hour of news everyday.</b>Encourage your child to read the subtitles (in the relevant MTL) if they are available as your child listens to the news. It will not only help your child improve his/her listening skills and increase his/her general knowledge, providing essays with more substance and depth, it will also help your child recognize more words and improve your child’s grammar.  
  
<b>3\. Watching appropriate TV programmes, reading newspapers, and magazines</b> during leisure time is perfectly fine and is in fact encouraged as long as the contents are suitable for your child’s age and your child knows how to manage his/her time well. When your child comes across an idiom or well written phrase which is inspiring, have your child write it down in his/her notebook and refer to the list from time to time.  

<b>4. Carry a pocket dictionary or have a dictionary app with you.</b> Encourage your child to check out the meaning of words immediately as your child encounters them, and while the context in which the unfamiliar words are being used is still fresh in his/her memory.  

<b>5.</b> Encourage your child to refrain from mixing vocabulary from different languages when speaking. Your child should only do that if it is a deliberate attempt to explain the meaning of certain words. Otherwise, your child should make a conscious <b>effort to speak proper and unadulterated MTL.</b>  
  
Have your child think again of the MTL grade that he/she would want to eventually achieve. Consistency is key. Have your child <b>start to work towards it. Now.</b>
