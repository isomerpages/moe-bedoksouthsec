Chinese Orchestra
=================

![](/images/COBackdrop22.png)
Since its beginnings 30 over years ago, the Chinese Orchestra has achieved much on its road to perfection. There is a strong traditional culture within the CCA which cultivates self-discipline in every child. 

Chinese Orchestra is a CCA that not only cultivates musical talents but also inculcates strong discipline in every student. We promote virtues of Chinese customs and values such as hardworking and perseverance through appreciating the story behind every scores that we played. 

Being part of Bedok South Secondary School Chinese Orchestra (BDSCO) family requires immense commitment and responsibility from each member of the orchestra. With all the hard work and dedication from our students, we achieve the Certificate of Distinction in Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation 2021. 

    
Students with no musical background get to learn the basics of music and gained opportunities to perform. We look forward to the years ahead where we will work harder and continue to pursue our passion for music and grow stronger as a team. We welcome you to join us!
