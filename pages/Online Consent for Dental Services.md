Online Consent for Dental Services
==================================

To promote good oral health for the students, the Health Promotion Board (HPB) continues to provide free dental checks and basic dental treatments (if required) at specified times during school hours in secondary schools.

Parents must give their consent before their child can receive such services.  

To make it more convenient and secure, HPB has launched the Child Consent Portal since 2016 for parents to submit your consent online. It only takes four steps:

 1. Log on to [https://consent.hpb.gov.sg/](https://consent.hpb.gov.sg/) or scan the QR code below to access the child consent portal.

2\. Login using your Singpass with 2-factor authentication (2FA). (You may register for Singpass by visiting&nbsp;[https://www.singpass.gov.sg](https://www.singpass.gov.sg/)&nbsp;OR any Singpass counter. The location of Singpass counters and instructions for 2FA activation are available on&nbsp;&nbsp;[https://www.singpass.gov.sg](https://www.singpass.gov.sg/).

3\. Type in your child's UIN/ BC/ FIN number.

4\. Fill up and submit the consent form.

HPB receives enrolment information progressively in batches. Should you be prompted at step 3 that HPB has not received your child’s/ ward’s enrolment information, please provide your email address via the portal. You will be notified via email once HPB receives your child’s/ ward’s enrolment information.
