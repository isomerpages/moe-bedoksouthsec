The annual CCA Fair and Aesthetics showcase held on 22 Jan 2016 provided Sec 1 students and their parents an opportunity to explore and engage with members of the various CCAs. The groups participating in the showcase comprised the Choir, Chinese Orchestra, Symphonic Band, Malay Dance Ensemble and Dance Society. In the performance segment, the audience were given a
glimpse of the intended outcomes of Performing Arts CCAs. Parents were able to observe how participation in these CCAs could develop their children’s musical or dance skills. The competency in the various art forms displayed by our students also gave parents an insight into the performance character values that would be cultivated through these CCAs, specifically perseverance, diligence and responsibility. The performances were well-received and certainly inspired many to join these CCAs.

In the parade segment, the Guest-of-Honour gracing the occasion was the Vice-Chairperson of our Parent Support Group, Ms Florence Chan, while the Guard-of-Honour was our National Civil Defence Cadet Corps. They were supported by our other Uniformed Groups - NCC (Land), NPCC, Scouts and Guides. Collectively, they demonstrated the resilience, leadership qualities and life skills that had been acquired from all their training sessions. The combined UG parade certainly wowed many among the crowds.

The Physical Sports groups also displayed their training routines and skills at their respective booths to the budding sporting talents while the clubs and societies showcased their projects to students who might want to develop their areas of specific interests. With the school’s CCA vision for all students to be **BDSians of exemplary Character and Abilities**, it is hoped that the preview of all the Co-Curricular Activities available has helped the Sec 1s make a more well-informed decision on their choice of CCA. The Sec 1 students commenced CCAs from 29 January onwards.
