##### **Science Talent Management Programme**

The Science Talent Management Programme is a two-year programme that provides students with opportunities to be exposed to science-related challenges beyond the main curriculum. The programme aims to stretch and develop passionate students with an aptitude in science through various activities ranging from workshops to competitions. Students work independently on Science projects under teachers’ mentorship to earn badges under the Questa Club Scheme by the Science Center, to gain a deeper appreciation for the discipline of Science and the ways of thinking and doing as a scientist.They also actively participate in workshops organized by NUS Demo Lab and the Science Center to competitions such as the Singapore Science Buskers Festival, where students grow and strengthen their research and communication skills as they acquire new knowledge and gain a deeper appreciation and passion for the various disciplines of Science.

### Farmathon 2022

On 30 July 2022, 2 teams of students participated in the MGS Farmathon 2022, an inter-school entrepreneurship competition organised by Methodist Girls’ School. This competition focuses on solving problems faced by Singapore’s farms and exposes students to business idea on increasing Singapore’s demand for locally produced food or on strengthening Singapore’s food security. Prior to this competition, the students even went on a learning journey to Singapore Indoor Farms which introduced them to farming in controlled environments. They visited a farm and were exposed to different types of hydroponic systems and also got to learn about seed germination. One group obtained the Certificate of Participation while the other clinched the Most Innovative Award.

### Visit to Yakult Factory 2023
Did you know that our Yakult is manufactured locally?

The Science Talent Management Programme BDSians went for a learning journey to the Yakult Factory today. They were each given a bottle of limited edition Yakult Light to enjoy, while listening to a presentation about Yakult - from its origins to the unique flavours of Yakult found only in Singapore. To sum up their learning, they even had a Kahoot quiz and three students walked away with prizes from Yakult!

There was also a facility tour, where our BDSians got to understand the processes involved in manufacturing the Yakult we purchase from retail stores. It was such an interesting trip for our students!

### Learning Journey to NUS Science Demo Lab

On 30 Mar, 13, 25 and 27 Apr, our secondary four physics students were given the opportunity to visit the Wonders of Science at NUS Science Demo Lab. It was a guided tour and the students had the opportunity to witness various science demonstrations that were visually impressive. Through interactive and hands-on activities, the students were able to review and deepen their understanding of various Physics concepts, ranging from forces and energy to waves and electricity. The demonstrations were interesting and had been enjoyable and fruitful for the students. &nbsp;It is our hope that such learning journey will ignite greater interest and passion for Science among the students.
