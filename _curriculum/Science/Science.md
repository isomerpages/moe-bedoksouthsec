<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>BDS Science curriculum aims to provide every student with the opportunity
to ignite their passion for inquiry-based learning through well-designed
experiments and hands-on activities, while developing values, ethics and
attitudes relevant to Science as a way of thinking and doing. Through varied
learner-centered teaching strategies, self-directed learning, enrichment
programmes and competitions, students are engaged in authentic learning
experiences within and beyond the Science classroom, to acquire skills
that will help them to make informed decisions about Science-related issues
in their everyday life.</p>
<h3>Student Outcomes</h3>
<p>Students will acquire and develop scientific knowledge, skills, values,
ethics and attitudes that will allow them to&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Tips for Parents</h3>
<p>To enjoy learning Science, it is important for you to encourage your child
to:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp; Be an <strong>active and inquisitive learner</strong> in the classroom
to participate in activities and ask questions when in doubt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. <strong>Understand the scientific concepts</strong> instead of memorising
them without understanding. This will help in <strong>applying</strong> these
concepts to novel questions and in <strong>interpreting</strong> data such
as graphs or tables.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Practice</strong> questions consistently and actively seek feedback
from teachers.</p>
