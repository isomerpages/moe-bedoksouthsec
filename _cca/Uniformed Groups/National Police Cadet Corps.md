### Activities

<b>A) Parades</b>

<b>I. NPCC Annual Parade</b>

The NPCC Annual Parade (NPAP) is the flagship event in the NPCC calendar. It marks the celebration of the NPCC Day and is also the day for the NPCC to honour the outstanding achievements of its units. It also aims to instil loyalty in the cadets & dedication to the Corps. The participation would be formed by all school representatives.

<b>II. National Day Parade</b>

The Singapore National Day Parade is a national ceremony to commemorate Singapore’s independence on 9th August. Every year, NPCC will form one supporting contingent in the National Day Parade. Our supporting contingent is made up of selected cadets from various units.

<b>B) Competitions</b>

<b>I. Inter-Unit Annual .22 Revolver Shooting Competition</b>

NPCC organises .22 Revolver Shooting Competition for its cadets annually. All units are invited to nominate a maximum of two teams of cadets to take part in the competition. Each team will comprise 5 cadets selected from Sec 3, 4, or 5 who must have participated in the Sec 3 Classification shoot prior to the competition. Eligible participants from the Preliminary Rounds would vie for the Championship Trophy in the Finals. The competition is held at Home Team Academy (HTA) Range.

<b>II. NPCC Campcraft Competition</b>

The Campcraft Competition is held once every two years. It alternates with the Inter-Unit Drill Competition.

There will be two categories in the competition: Boys’ Team and Girls’ Team. Competing teams were assessed on their abilities to apply campcraft skills in a standard set of components. The purpose of the competition is to promote efficiency in conducting outdoor activities and to encourage team-spirit among cadets.

<b>III. Inter-Unit Drill</b>

The drill competition is organised for all NPCC units annually. The competition aims to assess cadets’ proficiency in drills on a pre-determined set of competition criteria and to instil the qualities of innovation and enterprise amongst cadets.

<b>C) Activities</b>

<b>I. Beyond our Shoes (OEV)</b>

<b>OEV Hong Kong and OEV Sabah</b>

NPCC organises annual educational visits for our cadets and members. NPCC cadets and members have the opportunity to network, not just locally, but into foreign lands as well.

NPCC made its inaugural visit to RBPF and Brunei Police Cadet Corps in May 2011. Thereafter, NPCC continue to make its second visit to the RBPF and the Brunei Police Cadet Corps from 21 – 25 May 2012. The visit programmes include exchanges between SPF and RBPF and the two Police Cadet Corps. The cadets from both sides will have the opportunity to meet, interact and learn from each other.

<b>II. Bi-annual Combined UG Camp: Harmony Camp</b>

The purpose of the visit is to broaden the mental horizon of our cadets and members through first-hand knowledge of the economic, social and cultural aspects of the host country. The educational visits focus mainly on regional Asian countries that have similar set-up as the NPCC so that our cadets are further exposed to the Police-Youth partnership programme in other countries.

<b>II. Police Youth Ambassador - Sec 3 cadets</b> <br>
