Principles of Accounts
======================

### Introduction

Accounting is an information system based on accepted accounting principles. It involves the recording and processing of business transactions and communicating the information to stakeholders. Accounting information is used to evaluate business performance and facilitate decision-making. What sets the accountancy profession apart is the responsibility to act in the publicâ€™s interest.  

  

Principles of Accounts (POA), Syllabus 7087 and 7086, is designed to teach age-appropriate and relevant accounting knowledge, skills and values. In addition, students will understand how businesses use accounting and non-accounting information to make decisions. Through the subject, they will acquire transferrable skills that they can apply in their daily lives.

  

This subject forms part of a broad-based education to equip students with strong fundamentals for future learning. It is offered as an elective subject at Secondary Three and examinable at the Singapore-Cambridge General Certificate of Education (GCE) Ordinary Level (O-Level) and Normal (Academic) Level (N(A)-Level).


### Student Outcomes

It is the intent of this syllabus that students develop the abilities to **prepare, communicate** and **use** accounting information.

In the learning process, students will develop an understanding of the importance of **professional ethics**.

Students will be able to:

* apply the double entry system of recording business transactions

* organise and present accounting information in ledger accounts and financial statements

* analyse the effects of accounting transactions on financial statements

* analyse and interpret financial statements
 
* evaluate businesses for their profitability, liquidity and inventory management using financial information and ratios


### Curriculum

**Approach and Pedagogy**

* Adoption of Mixed Mode Delivery (MMD) such as demonstration, explicit teaching, games, inquiry, pair work and think-pair-share
* Linkage of concepts that students learn in the classroom to authentic businesses
* Practice of Assessment for Learning through relevant toolkits
* Usage of Differentiated Instructions (DI)
* Participation in competitions by external organisations
* Collaboration between schools on the sharing of question papers and mark schemes of Mid-year Examinations, End-of-year Examinations and Preliminary Examinations
