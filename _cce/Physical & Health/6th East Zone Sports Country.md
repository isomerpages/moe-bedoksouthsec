EZ Sports Carnival was organised to provide a second-tier sporting platform for lower secondary non-school sports CCA players who have not participated in any inter-school sports tournaments. The welcome address was delivered by the EZ Sports Development Committee Chairperson, Ms Pauline Fun (Principal/ Bedok South Secondary). The Guest-of- Honour, Mdm Fiona Yeo (Cluster Superintendent E6, Schools Division, Ministry of Education), gave a closing speech, as well as, presented the medals to the top 4 positions in each category.

Besides the EZ Sports Schools Development Chairperson, Mrs Judina Cheong EZ Schools Sports Council Chairperson (Principal/ Hai Sing Catholic) was also part of the VIP entourage. This year, in addition to the Certificates of Participation to everyone who took part in the Carnival, Sportsmanship prizes for players and teams who demonstrated good sportsmanship and positive values throughout the games, were not only recognised, their actions were highlighted for others to role-model. Six schools convened the eight categories of games at different areas within the two schools’ vicinity. Two schools also collaborated with ActiveSG to work on fringe activities that helped to minimise the waiting time of the participants. Those who performed well were given tokens of achievements. An estimated number of 928 students from 18 schools were involved in the carnival. The ceremonies were facilitated and games umpired by a total of about 100 student-leaders from the respective committee members’ schools.
