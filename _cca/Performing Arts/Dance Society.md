Dance Society
=============

![](/images/Dance1.jpg)

The Dance Society has evolved since its establishment in 2012. Since 2020, it focuses on Chinese Dance and Wushu. Using the vision of 4Es – Experience, Enrich, Engage and Explore to plan its programmes, the Dance Society promises to develop its members holistically.

Besides experiencing the various movements in the Chinese Dance and Wushu, students’ experiences were further enriched when they participated in competitions and performances. The Dance Society achieved Certificate of Distinction in the 2021 SYF Arts Presentation in the Chinese Dance category and Wushu achieved different awards in the various events they competed in the National Wushu and Sanda competition 2021 and National School Games in 2021 and 2022. Students also performed yearly for the Chinese New Year concert in school and National Day Dinner at community centres.

To allow students to explore and enhance their passion in dance, programmes such as watching professional arts groups performances have been planned. CCA leaders also attended the yearly Ampliefied!DanceLab organized by Arts Education Branch. This helps them to explore their passion in dance as they interact with other students and professionals during this two-day course.

As members of the society, it is important to inculcate empathy and encourage students to actively engage with the community. Students participated yearly in Values-in-Action (VIA) activities. In 2022, students work with Thye Hua Kwan Bedok Radiance Seniors Activity Centre at Bedok South Road. They helped out by engaging and encouraging the elderly during their keep fit programme and packed food rations and distributed to the elderly in their respective HDB units.
