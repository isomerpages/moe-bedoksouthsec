NDLP Info Site for Staff and Students
=====================================

Click [here](https://go.gov.sg/bsssictpd) to access to BSSS ICT Professional Development Site.

We hope that this site will be helpful for colleagues who wish to explore the various ICT applications available for use in classrooms.

If you have good guides/videos which you find will be useful for teachers, please email to [bsss@moe.edu.sg](mailto:bsss@moe.edu.sg).

Thank you!
