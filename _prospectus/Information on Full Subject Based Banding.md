### Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB)

Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) is part of MOE’s ongoing efforts to nurture the joy of learning and develop multiple pathways to cater to the different strengths and interests of our students.

With Full SBB, we are moving towards a secondary school education where students learn each subject at the level that best caters to their overall strengths, interests and learning needs.

Full SBB aims for students to:  
1\. Have greater ownership of their learning according to their strengths, interests, abilities, talents and learning needs  
2\. Develop a **growth mindset and an intrinsic motivation** to learn for life  
3\. Have **more opportunities to interact with friends** of different strengths, interests, abilities and talents  
4\. Have **more options for post-secondary pathways**, while ensuring they have strong fundamentals and can thrive in their chosen pathway

Thus, students who go through Full SBB will experience:

*   Mixed form classes upon entering secondary school
    
*   Greater flexibility to offer subjects at various subject levels
    
*   Shift away from stream-based subject offerings
    

### **Common Curriculum Subjects**

Students will take **six common curriculum subjects** with peers from their form class. These subjects are Art, Character & Citizenship Education, Design & Technology, Food & Consumer Education, Music and Physical Education. These subjects take up approximately one-third of curriculum time, giving students time to interact with classmates of different strengths and interests.

For other subjects, students can take them at **different subject levels (i.e. G1, G2 or G3)** according to their strengths, interests and learning needs.

Eligible students can take some subjects at a **more or less demanding level** at appropriate junctures. School will advise students accordingly based on holistic considerations.

### Offering Humanities subjects at a more demanding level

Students will also be able to offer **Humanities subjects** (Geography, History, and Literature in English) at a more demanding level from Secondary Two. The criteria for taking Humanities at a more demanding level will be based on students' aptitude for and interest in these subjects at Secondary One.
