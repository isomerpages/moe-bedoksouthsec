<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The BDS Floorball CCA started in 2008 and has grown in size and strength
since. There are now close to 90 girls and boys, representing the school
in the B and C divisions.</p>
<p>Our players train at least twice a week. They start off by learning the
basic skills and rules of the sport, and also develop various skills such
as teamwork and communication, and values such as resilience, discipline
and leadership.</p>
<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>Every floorballer, a skillful player, who plays with sportsmanship, and
is full of character.
<br>

<h3>Achievement</h3>
<p>The 2022 and 2023 National School Games (NSG) seasons post-Covid restrictions
proved to be challenging but yet fulfilling for BDS Floorball. The C Division
Boys team emerged 4th in the 2023 National School Games and our C Division
Girls emerged 1st runner up in the same competition in 2022. Our teams
all played with a seamless blend of skill, strategy, and unwavering determination.
Their outstanding teamwork and relentless drive, even in the face of adversity,
exemplified their resilience. Their passion for the sport truly set them
apart, with every player displaying an infectious enthusiasm for the game.
These wins are a testament to their dedication, unity, and unwavering spirit,
making them true champions in every aspect of the game.</p>
