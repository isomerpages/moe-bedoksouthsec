### National Digital Literacy Programme


At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning to help students strengthen their digital literacy. One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD) by end-2021.

  

The following provides important information about how you can purchase the PLD for your child/ward as well as the accompanying applications that the school will be rolling out as part of the NDLP.

The school aims to empower every BDSian to be a positive, future-ready, digital learner who can embrace the use of technology as a key enabler to effectively engage in the Active Learning process, both independently or with others; and to spark joy of learning anytime, anywhere. All students will see themselves employing technology even more purposefully to enhance their learning interactions, enabling them to learn actively in independent as well as collaborative settings, both within and outside their classrooms. Students will also acquire digital literacy in the four components of Ministry of Education (MOE)’s Digital Literacy Framework:

As part of the NDLP, schools will progressively roll out IT applications that will be vital to students’ learning experience and educational journey. In the following months, MOE will roll out some or all of the following applications:

(a)&nbsp;<b>Student iCON:</b>&nbsp;MOE will give every secondary school student an email address. This is a service provided by Google as part of Google Suite. Click&nbsp;[here](https://workspace.google.com/dashboard)&nbsp;to access the student iCON.

(b)&nbsp;<b>Microsoft Pro Plus:</b>&nbsp;every secondary school will be granted a licence to use Microsoft Office tools that include Word, PowerPoint and Excel.


The school will need to use your child/ward’s personal data such as his/her name and class to set up user accounts.

The school may also roll out applications other than those listed above. The school will need to use your child’s/ward’s personal data such as his/her name and class to set up these user accounts.
