### Overview

The Bedok South Swim Team comprises swimmers from diverse backgrounds and experiences who have come together to help one another achieve their personal best. The team has represented the school in the National School Games competitions since 2017 and the swimmers’ hard work and dedication have earned them places in the finals for both freestyle and medley relays.  

Besides training together once a week, the CCA also provides ample opportunities for character development. Our swimmers have put their skills to good use by participating in events such as Swim for Hope organised by SAFRA to raise funds for charity, and by creating a video to educate the school community on various water safety measures.

### Objectives

*   To develop character, mental and physical well-being in the swimmers
*   To provide training for students to swim competitively
*   To develop qualities of sportsmanship and leadership
*   To teach students to respect one another and work as a team
