Enhanced school measures for novel coronavirus
==============================================

Dear parents

As school re-opens on 29 Jan 2020, MOE will be enhancing precautionary measures, including daily temperature taking, to ensure that our schools remain a safe and healthy learning environment.

<u>Please ensure your child brings an Oral Digital Thermometer to school from 29 Jan onwards.</u>

While teachers actively look out for students’ well-being, please ensure your child practises good personal hygiene and social responsibility. You should take your child to the doctor if he/she is unwell and we would appreciate it that you keep your child at home until he/she recovers.

If your child has returned from <u>mainland China on 15 Jan or later</u>, he/she will be placed on Leave of Absence (LOA) for a period of <u>14 days</u>, starting from the first day after return. For example, if your child returns to Singapore on 28 Jan (Tue), the LOA would last from 29 Jan to 11 Feb, with the date of return to school being 12 Feb (Wed).

Students on LOA will be supported by home-based learning assigned by the school. If you have any queries on LOA, you can call the school office at 6441 4479. For updates on the coronavirus situation, you can visit moh.gov.sg or sign up at go.gov.sg/whatsapp to receive the latest information via WhatsApp. We will keep you updated on school measures and education related notifications.
