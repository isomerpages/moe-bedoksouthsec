CCA LEAPS and grading system
============================

### LEAPS 2.0 Domains


<b>(For New Sec 1 Students From 2014 Onwards)</b>

<b>Participation</b> <br>
This domain recognises students’ participation in one school-based Co-Curricular Activity&nbsp;(CCA). Recognition is based on the number of years of participation and exemplary conduct&nbsp;and active contributions to the CCA. Sustained engagement in the same CCA allows for&nbsp;progressive development of character, skills, knowledge and friendships, and will be&nbsp;accorded higher recognition.

<b>Achievement</b> <br>
This domain recognises students’ representation and accomplishment in co-curricular&nbsp;involvements beyond the classroom. Opportunities for representation and accomplishment&nbsp;present valuable learning experiences for students to learn discipline, resilience and&nbsp;develop their character. Students may represent the school or organisations endorsed by&nbsp;the school. Recognising external opportunities better caters to students’ diverse interests&nbsp;and talents. It also recognises the community’s role in developing the child.&nbsp;Representation refers to being selected and endorsed by the school or an organisation&nbsp;endorsed by the school (e.g. the community club or national association) to contribute,&nbsp;perform or compete. It need not be tied to his/her CCA in school.&nbsp;Accomplishment refers to attaining accolades and awards at competitions, festivals,&nbsp;performances, exhibitions, conferences and symposiums where the student represents the&nbsp;school or other organisations endorsed by the school.
  
<b>Leadership</b> <br>
This domain recognises students’ leadership development. Recognition is accorded to&nbsp;students’ ability to take charge of personal development, work in a team and assume&nbsp;responsibilities in service of others. In addition to formal leadership appointments,&nbsp;participation in student leadership modules/workshops, and leadership positions in the school, CCA or student-initiated/student-led&nbsp;projects will also be recognised.

  

<b>Service</b> <br> 
This domain recognises students’ development as socially responsible citizens who&nbsp;contribute meaningfully to the community. Every secondary school student will contribute at&nbsp;least 6 hours per school year to the community. They can choose to embark on a Values-In-Action project (VIA). Students will be recognised for the time they put into planning, service&nbsp;and reflection, when participating in a VIA project.

  

<b>Recognition of Students’ Level of Attainment</b> <br> 
At the end of the graduating year, students’ co-curricular attainment will be recognised&nbsp;according to Excellent/Good/Fair. The level of attainment will be converted to a bonus&nbsp;point(s) which can be used for admission to Junior Colleges/ Polytechnics/ Institutes of&nbsp;Education (JC/Poly/ITE).
