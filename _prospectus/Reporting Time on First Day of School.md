Reporting Time on First Day of School
=====================================

Our Secondary One students’ <b>reporting time for Day 1 (3 Jan 2023) is 8.50 am. Students are to report to the School Hall for morning assembly.</b> There will be student leaders on standby to chaperone the students to the school hall.

  

<b>From Day 2 (4 Jan 2023 onwards), Secondary One students will follow the normal reporting time for school which is 7.45 am</b>. Students are advised to report to school by 7.40 am so that they have time to make their way to their classroom. Students who arrive at the classroom after 7.45 am will be considered late for school. Up until 7.45 am, students are required to read their storybooks silently. All students must bring their own storybooks.
