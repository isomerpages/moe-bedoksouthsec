<h1>Information for Secondary One (2025 Cohort)</h1>
<p>Congratulations on your posting to Bedok South Secondary School. We are
happy to welcome you to the OneBDS family to embark on your secondary school
education.</p>
<p>This year, the incoming Sec 1 students are <strong><u>not required</u></strong> to
physically report to their posted secondary school on the next working
day following the release of S1 Posting Results. As such, we will be posting
all the necessary information applicable to our new Sec 1 on the school
website to communicate with you and your parents on the details for the
upcoming school term.</p>
<p><strong>The school will also be engaging parents online via a Zoom Webinar Session on 20 December 2024 (Friday), 9:00 a.m., for a Welcome Session by our school Principal and Year Head (Lower Secondary).</strong>
