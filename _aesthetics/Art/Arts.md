### Introduction

In BDS, students engage with the concepts of artists artworks and audience. Art practice involves experiences, practical and critical thinking, conceptual and spatial inquiry and the analysis of artworks from a range of viewpoints as artists and audience. Students make individual and collaborative artworks that communicate their artistic intentions and use skills of observation, interpretation and analysis to critically evaluate their own and othersâ€™ artworks. 

#### Student Outcomes

The Art Programme aims to : 
 - Nurture an informed awareness and appreciation of art and design
 - Cultivate an inquiring mind, a spirit of experimentation and a passion for art and design
 - Develop competency in the use of art elements and design principles, materials and processes

#### Curriculum

The curriculum refers to the content and learning experiences that support the acquisition of the above student outcomes. The key features of the curriculum comprise learning goals and content, pedagogy and assessment.

#### Learning Goals and Content

In BDS, the general art programme is conducted semestrally. Students acquire foundational skills to be visually literate and appreciate art in two components: Fine Art and Digital Art. 


Students learn to apply the elements and principles of art through thoughtful art making projects that apply skills like observational contour line drawing and water colour/ acrylic paint techniques. Through the process of image gathering, exploration and development, students are able to craft and design art works that imbue their personality and characteristics, creating works that give them a sense of achievement and ownership.


In Digital Art, students learn digital imaging skills and methods of digital image manipulation This component allows students to harness technologies in unleashing imagination and expressing their thoughts and ideas.


Students who have an interest and demonstrated aptitude in art are encouraged to elect for the upper secondary art programme. This is a rigorous and disciplined area of study that will equip them with the requisite knowledge, skills and values to pursue higher education in art and design in their chosen career paths.

More details of the upper secondary art syllabus can be obtained from the SEAB website in the links below:

#### Pedagogy

A key teaching approach applied in the art programme is differentiated instruction to cater to the
diverse needs and abilities of students within the programme. This ensures that students are able to express themselves to the best of their ability. The department strives to provide opportunities for students to explore and experiment with
different media, materials and techniques.

#### Assessment

Art achievement standards indicate the quality of learning that students should typically demonstrate. The sequence of achievement describes progress in the learning area, and provides students a framework of growth and learning in the subject. Students are also assessed on subject-specific terminology and organisation that reflects the essential characteristics of learning with the subject.

Student portfolios of creative work illustrate the expected learning and help teachers to make judgments about whether students have achieved the standard at each level.
