<h1>Information on PDLP Onboarding</h1>
<p>Digital technology is becoming increasingly pervasive in jobs, workplaces
and society. The National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) was launched
in 2020 to make digital learning inclusive by equipping students with the
digital literacies to be future-ready.</p>
<p>Through the NDLP, all secondary school students will own a school-prescribed
Personal Learning Device (PLD). Singapore Citizen students can use their
Edusave Account to pay for the PLD. The device will be used to facilitate
an environment that encourages personalised learning.</p>
<h3>Implementation @ BDS<br></h3>

<p><strong>Storage in school available:</strong> Lockers
<br><strong>Platforms/tools</strong>: Student Learning Space (SLS) as primary
platform, complemented by a host of other apps and tools that the school
has an overview of (some of which may be subject-specific).</p>
<h3>Funding Support for Singapore Citizen (SC) Students</h3>
<p><strong>The cost of the device bundle can be paid using your child’s Edusave account, </strong>after
setting aside provision for payment of second-tier miscellaneous fees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;For students on MOE-FAS, subsidies are available even if there is
insufficient Edusave balance. The cash out-of-pocket will be $0.</p>
<h3>Funding Support for Non-Singapore Citizen Students</h3>
<p>Financial assistance is also available for Permanent residents (PR) and
international students (IS) who need support.</p>
<h3>Supporting Students in the Responsible Use of the Devices</h3>
<p>&nbsp;The school has in place some measures <strong>to enable a safe and seamless learning environment for students. </strong>The
role of the parent is also key in partnering the school to support your
child.</p>
