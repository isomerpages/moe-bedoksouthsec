Science &amp; Environment Club
==========================


### Overview

The Science and Environment Club nurtures students' knowledge and thinking about scientific and environmental issues. It aims to develop students' interest in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) and equip them with baseline skills necessary to pursue a career in STEM. 

The club seeks student opinions and feedback, and tailors programmes to cater to their learning needs each year. In the course of 2023, the club has run the following science modules for the students:

* Introduction to Microscopy Using Leaves from the Garden
* Introduction to Titration Using Vitamin C and Iodine
* Making Plastic Out of Milk
* Introduction to Nature-journaling of Plants in the Garden
* Party Science: Balloon-sculpting and the Reaction of Mentos with Coke
* Chemistry of Chocolate @ Science Centre
* Molecular Gastronomy @ Science Centre
* Learning Journey @ NEWater Visitor Centre
* Intermediate Nature-journaling of Birds @ Bird Paradise
* Inter-Pentangular Competition @ St Hilda's Secondary School
* Visit and Experience @ The Gem Museum

The club continued its third year of work with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Eco-Schools Programme this year. Students in the Executive Committee (EXCO) have used the Seven Steps Approach from UNESCO's Education for Sustainable Development framework in their project to Change the Way You Think About Waste. The EXCO has led its members to run the following programmes to reduce the plastic waste in school:
* Introduction to Circular Economy via Assembly Talk
* Making Beeswax Sandwich Wraps to Replace Plastic Bags
* Learning About Plastic Waste via School-Wide Quiz
* Setup of Recycling Boxes for All Plastic Bottles in the Canteen
* Illustrate Posters to Influence the School to Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle Plastic
* School-Wide Design Thinking Competition to Generate Ideas on Reducing, Reusing, and Recycling Plastic
* Reflections and Learning on Activating Changes

### Achievements
Gabrielle Angelica Pereira of Class 4A and Conrad Yeah of Class represented the school to receive the Eco-Schools Bronze Award from WWF this year as they had led a consistent group of students to contribute meaningfully and significantly to the whole school's efforts to cultivate an understanding of food waste and to take actions to tackle the corresponding issues in 2022.
