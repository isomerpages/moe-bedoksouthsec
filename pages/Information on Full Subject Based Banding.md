<h3>Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB)</h3>
<p>Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) is part of MOEâ€™s ongoing efforts
to nurture the joy of learning and develop multiple pathways to cater to
the different strengths and interests of our students.</p>
<p>With Full SBB, we are moving towards a secondary school education where
students learn each subject at the level that best caters to their overall
strengths, interests and learning needs.</p>
<p>Full SBB aims for students to:
<br>1. Have greater ownership of their learning according to their strengths,
interests, abilities, talents and learning needs
<br>2. Develop a <strong>growth mindset and an intrinsic motivation</strong> to
learn for life
<br>3. Have <strong>more opportunities to interact with friends</strong> of
different strengths, interests, abilities and talents
<br>4. Have <strong>more options for post-secondary pathways</strong>, while
ensuring they have strong fundamentals and can thrive in their chosen pathway</p>
<p>Thus, students who go through Full SBB will experience:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Mixed form classes upon entering secondary school</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Greater flexibility to offer subjects at various subject levels</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shift away from stream-based subject offerings</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Common Curriculum Subjects</strong></h3>
<p>Students will take <strong>six common curriculum subjects</strong> with
peers from their form class. These subjects are Art, Character &amp; Citizenship
Education, Design &amp; Technology, Food &amp; Consumer Education, Music
and Physical Education. These subjects take up approximately one-third
of curriculum time, giving students time to interact with classmates of
different strengths and interests.</p>
<p>For other subjects, students can take them at <strong>different subject levels (i.e. G1, G2 or G3)</strong> according
to their strengths, interests and learning needs.</p>
<p>Eligible students can take some subjects at a <strong>more or less demanding level</strong> at
appropriate junctures. School will advise students accordingly based on
holistic considerations.</p>

<h3>Offering Humanities subjects at a more demanding level</h3>
<p>Students will also be able to offer <strong>Humanities subjects</strong> (Geography,
History, and Literature in English) at a more demanding level from Secondary
Two. The criteria for taking Humanities at a more demanding level will
be based on students' aptitude for and interest in these subjects at Secondary
One.</p>
