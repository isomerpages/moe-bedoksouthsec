<h1>Information on School Smart Card</h1>
<p><strong>(STUDENT IDENTIFICATION PASS/ CONCESSIONARY TRAVEL SCHOOL SMART CARD (SSC))</strong>
</p>
<p>1. Please be informed that students can continue to use their primary
level School Smart Card (SSC) for concessionary travel till 30 April 2025.</p>
<p>2. While waiting for their Secondary level SSC to be ready, they have
the option of purchasing a Monthly Concession Pass (MCP), which is available
at any TransitLink Ticket Office and Add Value Machine Plus. The MCPs can
be encoded to start from any specified date up to 7 days in advance. Students
will need to purchase the MCP for <u>Secondary School</u> students.</p>

<p>3. For Primary School Smartcard, concession fare will be deducted during
the 4 months and Secondary concession pass can be purchased.</p>
<p>4. We would like to advise all Secondary 1 students to return their old
Primary School Smartcard to TransitLink once they have received their new
Secondary level SSC. At any point of time during the 4 months grace period,
you may request for an immediate refund (if any) at any TransitLink Ticket
Office or Concession Card Replacement Office. Once the 4 month period is
up, studentâ€™s card will expire and cannot be used or refunded immediately.
Students will then be issued a receipt and the refund can be collected
after 5 working days from any TransitLink Ticket Office or Concession Card
Replacement Office.</p>
<p>5. The new Secondary level SSC will be issued in Feb or Mar 2025. More
information will be given closer to the date.</p>
