### WELCOME TO THE EXCITING WORLD OF THE BDS AESTHETICS DEPARTMENT


  

### Introduction&nbsp;
-------------

“Imagination is more important than knowledge.

For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand, while imagination embraces the entire world and all there ever will be to know and understand.  

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Albert&nbsp;Einstein

Aesthetic disciplines engage, inspire and enrich all students, exciting their imagination and encouraging them to reach their creative and expressive potential.  

In Bedok South Sec, students learn to express their ideas, thoughts and opinions as designers, culinary artists, visual artists and musicians.&nbsp; They acquire skills and develop critical understanding that informs decision-making and aesthetic choices.
