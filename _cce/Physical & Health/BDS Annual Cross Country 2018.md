At the dawn of 1st March 2018, the assembly area of the annual cross country run in Bedok Reservoir filled up with students. The atmosphere was exhilarating as students from all levels, eager to participate in the 4 kilometre run, all gathered.


This was the first year that the school has implemented the class flags as a competition category to promote camaraderie and esprit de corps among the students of the various classes.

The event saw students from all levels competing against one another to clinch the top titles. Some of the top 10 winners are invited to represent the school in the National Inter-School Cross-Country Championships which will be held on 21 March 2018.
