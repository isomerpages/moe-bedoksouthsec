Information on Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) 2023
=====================================================

Singapore Citizens in financial need can get assistance from MOE on school fees and other expenses. This applies to government, government-aided, specialised and some independent schools.

  

Students whose application for MOE FAS have been approved earlier by their primary schools will be contacted directly by the FAS officer, Ms Mardhiah on the assigned date and time for onsite collection via our school FAS Whatsapp service. Should there be any concerns or if you did not receive any notification from our school, please Whatsapp the FAS line @ 86866208 for assistance.

  

Parents who wish to apply, can choose to do so via the FAS online (EFAS) ([https://go.gov.sg/moe-efas](https://go.gov.sg/moe-efas)), download the FAS application form from the school website or collect the hardcopy at the General Office. For hardcopy submissions, please submit the application form and the required supporting documents as stated in the application form to the General Office. If your documents are in order, we will be able to process your application between 7 to 10 working days and we will notify you of the status accordingly. Otherwise, we will process your application when the documents are completed.

  

If you have any enquiries regarding Financial Assistance matters, you may contact Ms Mardhiah at 6441 4479 ext. 130.
