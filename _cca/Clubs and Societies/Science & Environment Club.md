Science & Environment Club
==========================


![Science & Environment Club](/images/Science-and-Environment.jpg)

### Overview

The Science Society comprises 4 main sub-groups:   
(i) Robotics   
(ii) PET Rockets   
(iii) Environment   
(iv) Visits  
  

The first 3 sub-groups devote their activities to their members’ enrichment and excellence in that particular field. They also provide opportunities for members to take part and be engaged in various competitions (zonal, national and international level) held throughout the year. 

  

The Visits sub-group engages themselves in organising field-trips and visits for the members to various attractions in Singapore that allow members to enrich themselves in scientific knowledge and discovery. These attractions include Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, Marina Barrage, The Southern Ridges (forest walk) and visits to the Science Centre. These learning journeys not only enable students to appreciate nature and science better through first-hand discovery, they also serve as an eye-opener for many students. 

  

A highlight of this year would be the students’ visit to the Science Centre for an iMax Movie about The Panda Adventure. A group of Science Society students also participated in the EduRace 2013 organised by Tampines Junior College to complete en-route tasks to raise awareness among the students on the scarcity of water in Singapore. 

  

The Environment sub-group has been engaged in activities to better appreciate the Earth and raise awareness on the need to save the Earth from Man’s harmful activities. Our members have organised workshops for neighbouring secondary schools to engage them in fun-filled and hands-on ‘green’ activities. They have also visited the ABC Water Trail @ Lorong Halus and the Alpha Biodiesel Plant and Incineration Plant as part of their learning journeys.
