2022 O-Level Results Release
============================

The GCE O-Level results can be viewed via the SEAB Candidates Portal at https:// myexams.seab.gov.sg from 12 January 2023, 2.45pm. The system will be available for candidates to access their results until 26 January 2023, 11.59pm.

  

GCE O-Level candidates who are eligible for Singpass are to apply and activate their Singpass account so that they can view their results online. For students Singpass PIN had expired, they can reset their password instantly online or request for a new PIN mailer via Singpass website ([www.singpass.gov.sg](http://www.singpass.gov.sg/)). For candidates who are not eligible for Singpass, i.e. International Students, SEAB will send a system- generated username to their email address a few days before the results release.

  

The guide to access the SEAB result release system is attached [here](/files/CP%20User%20Guide%20-%20GCE%20Schools.pdf) for your reference. A copy of the guide can also be found on the SEAB website.
