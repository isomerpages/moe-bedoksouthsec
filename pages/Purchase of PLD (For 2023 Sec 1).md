Purchase of PLD (For 2023 Sec 1)
================================

The PLD will be used in tandem with the national e-learning platform - the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) - as well as other educational technology to personalize and enhance students' learning. This will also enable students to acquire digital skills and apply these skills as they navigate an increasingly digitalized world.  
  
As part of NDLP, the school has made arrangement for the purchase of personal learning device (PLD) for your child/ward.  
  
Every BDSian will be using the Apple iPad as their PLD. Every iPad will come with the Apple Pencil (Gen 1) and Logitech Slim Folio keyboard to maximise the affordance of the iPad as a learning tool.

For parents/guardians&nbsp;without Singpass, please submit the&nbsp;<b>hardcopy letter to your child’s/ward’s Form Teacher</b>.
