### Arts Fiesta

The Arts Fiesta is a platform for students to experience and perform their musical arrangements in school to a wider audience beyond the classroom. They also have an opportunity to learn from their peers in music making activities. Students are encouraged to use this platform to deepen their interest and passion in music in a safe and positive environment.
