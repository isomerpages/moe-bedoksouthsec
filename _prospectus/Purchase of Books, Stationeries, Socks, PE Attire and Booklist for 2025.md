<h1>Purchase of Books/ Stationeries &amp; OneBDS 2<sup>nd</sup> Uniform/ PE Attire for 2026</h1>
<p><strong><u>Recommended Sets of Full Uniform and (OneBDS 2<sup>nd</sup> Uniform) to be Purchased</u></strong>
<br>
<br>It is advised for students to purchase one set of full uniform (school
uniform blouse/shirt, tie, school pants/skirt), two school pants/skirts,
and two OneBDS 2<sup>nd </sup>Uniform Polo T-shirts.</p>
<p>Students are strongly encouraged to purchase two OneBDS 2<sup>nd</sup> Uniform
Polo T-shirts as it is the school’s 2<sup>nd</sup> uniform attire, and students
would usually prefer to wear the Polo T-shirt instead of the full uniform
due to the warm weather. Students may also choose to wear the full school
uniform (excluding the school tie) if they prefer. The full uniform is
typically worn during formal occasions, such as Speech Day or when representing
the school at external events.
<br>
<br><em>Please be informed that the OneBDS 2<sup>nd</sup> Uniform Polo T-shirt is </em><strong><em><u>not allowed</u></em></strong><em> to be used as a PE attire as they serve different functionality and purpose.</em>
