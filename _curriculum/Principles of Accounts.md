Principles of Accounts
======================

### Aims

The primary aim of the POA syllabus is to develop in students the knowledge and skills to prepare, communicate, and use both accounting information and non-accounting information related to business to make decisions.

The syllabus then aims to help students to become users of accounting information and make informed decisions using both accounting and non-accounting business-related information. Students will learn and understand the following:

*   What business decisions are,
*   How decisions are made using accounting information,
*   The limitations of relying only on accounting information, and
*   The consideration of non-accounting business-related information.

### Examples of POA Learning Experiences in BDS

**Hosting School for the National Financial Literacy Challenge 2025: Empowering Minds, Shaping Futures!**

<br> On 10 July 2025, BDS proudly hosted the National Financial Literacy Challenge for the second consecutive year! 🎉  
  
Jointly organised by the East Zone Principles of Accounts Networked Learning Community (EZ POA NLC) and the Central Provident Fund Board (CPFB), with strong support from the CPDD Commerce Unit, this nationwide event brought together an amazing 395 students from 42 schools across Singapore.  
  
This unique platform enabled our Secondary Three POA students across Singapore to:  
📘 Observe the real-world relevance between POA and Financial Literacy  
🧠 Apply their POA knowledge to make sense of financial concepts  
📊 Understand the importance of financial planning for the future  
  
Throughout the day, we witnessed students displaying the following competencies:  
💬 Adaptive thinking, critical thinking and computational thinking  
🤝 Teamwork and collaboration  
🧩 Interpersonal communication  
🔥 Dispositions, such as tenacity, meticulousness, and curiosity  
  
🙌 A special shout-out to our very own inaugural cohort of 30 BDS Game Testers and Facilitators (Sec 3 POA students), who stepped up to support this national platform to advocate for the importance of financial literacy!  
Together, we are building not just financial literacy, but also future-ready, socially responsible learners.  
  
❤️ A big thank you to all educators, partners, and supporters who made this meaningful experience possible. Let’s continue to ignite learning, inspire confidence, and invest in our students’ future!❤️
