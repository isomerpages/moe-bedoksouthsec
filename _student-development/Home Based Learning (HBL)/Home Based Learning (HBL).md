### Overview of Home-Based Learning (HBL) 
--------------------------------------

At Bedok South Secondary School, we strive to provide an effective and conducive home-based learning experience for our students. With blended learning as a key feature of the schooling experience to further develop self-directed, passionate and life-long learners, HBL@BDS will be conducted every fortnight in 2022. Students will tap on the resources on the Student Learning Space(SLS) which complements with in-school activities to facilitate learning.  All Secondary 1 to 3 students are also equipped with a Personal Learning Device (PLD) under the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) and can tap on the various affordances provided by the PLD.

### Student-Initiated Learning (SIL)
--------------------------------

SIL is an opportunity for you to learn to be an independent, passionate and lifelong learner. It is a dedicated time during HBL for you to explore personal interests, both within and outside of curriculum. You will find the SIL module (E.g. ‘SIL Class 1A’) once you log on to SLS. Students are given a choice of SILs with the SIL playlist and should complete your preferred **5 SILs by each term**. Please click on the [SIL guide](/files/SIL_Student%20Guide.pdf) to find out how you can go about doing your SILs.
