Principles of Accounts
======================

### Aims

The primary aim of the POA syllabus is to develop in students the knowledge and skills to prepare, communicate, and use both accounting information and non-accounting information related to business to make decisions.

The syllabus then aims to help students to become users of accounting information and make informed decisions using both accounting and non-accounting business-related information. Students will learn and understand the following:

*   What business decisions are,
*   How decisions are made using accounting information,
*   The limitations of relying only on accounting information, and
*   The consideration of non-accounting business-related information.
