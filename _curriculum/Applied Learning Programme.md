<h1>Applied Learning Programme</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In our effort to provide a vibrant learner-centered environment that is
conducive to student development and achievement, we have introduced the
Applied Learning Programme (Project S.H.I.N.E) since 2014 where students
work towards solutions to problems that address a genuine need in the real
world, to nurture stewards of the environment and society.</p>
<h3>Student Outcomes</h3>
<p>The programme aims to develop:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Motivated learners with life-long values, skills&nbsp;and&nbsp;21st&nbsp;century competencies</strong>&nbsp;who
are able to work in teams or independently, to experiment with ideas, explore
their talent and contribute to the community.&nbsp;Students will see the
relevance and value of what they are learning and develop in them a joy
for learning and entrepreneurial spirit.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Empathetic, innovative and critical thinkers&nbsp;who can apply their knowledge, skills and values</strong>&nbsp;in
real-life situations.&nbsp;They will experience the sense of purpose and
achievement that comes with productive activity. Students will seek to
greater understand the needs of their target audience and to empathise
with them through iterations of meaningful conversations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Effective communicators and collaborators who serve with conviction.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Over
time, students come to regard themselves as people who can make a difference
to their own lives and in the quality of the lives of other people. Students
will learn to tap on each other’s strengths and assigned varying roles
in order to collaboratively work as a team among a group of diverse learners.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Approach &amp; Pedagogy</h3>
<p>Project SHINE employs the Design Thinking framework, a user-centred innovation
problem-finding and problem-solving process to engage in innovation projects
known as Design Challenges. Project SHINE also provides opportunities for
students to use Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM)
as a platform for problem-finding and problem-solving. Through biweekly
classroom sessions with journaling on E-portfolios, learning journeys and
tinkering in the ‘Xplore and Design Space, students will be equipped with
the skills to identify challenges, gather information, generate potential&nbsp;solutions,
refine ideas, test and market solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Design Thinking framework we adopt follows the following 4 phases:</p>

<h4>I) Secondary One (Experience &amp; Expose) and Secondary Two (Empower &amp; Enrich)</h4>
<hr>
<p>Secondary 1 students are introduced to the Design Thinking cycle to build
empathy and reframe problems into opportunities through various learning
experiences such as workshops and learning journeys. In Secondary 2, students
are given opportunities to extend the skillset and mindset of Design Thinking
which they have learnt in Secondary 1 through other learning experiences.
These include those that develop marketing strategies to inculcate the
spirit of entrepreneurial dare. Students also participate in the annual
National Youth Upcycling Movement to introduce a culture of sustainability
through upcycling and green consumerism through upcycling tips and learning
about plastic waste.</p>
<h4>II) Secondary Three (Excel)</h4>
<hr>
<p>Selected students who have shown a deeper ability to apply their understanding
of the Design Thinking framework are selected to further explore their
interest by partaking in carefully chosen national competitions including
the MOE Innovation Programme and Tan Kah Kee Young Inventors’ Award. These
opportunities allow students to explore and develop areas of strengths
and interests as well as to better understand the post-secondary pathways,
evolving job landscapes and future career choices.</p>
