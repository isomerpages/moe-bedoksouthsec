Elements of Business Skills
===========================

The Elements of Business Skills (EBS) syllabus is designed as an introduction to business concepts by understanding business activities, focusing on basic marketing and customer relations, in
Singapore’s context. Students will have opportunities to acquire foundational business knowledge
and develop transferable employability skills in the service industry, namely the Travel and
Tourism, Hospitality and Retail industries.

  

The service industry continues to play a significant role in Singapore’s economic growth and
offers employment opportunities. With globalisation, changing demographics and technological
advancement, businesses are innovating and reinventing themselves to stay ahead of the
competition. The study of EBS in the selected industries would provide students with opportunities
to learn and develop 21st Century Competencies (Figure 1.1) needed to thrive in an increasingly
volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous world.

### Introduction
