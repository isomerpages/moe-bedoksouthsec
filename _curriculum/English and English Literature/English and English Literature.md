<h1>English and English Literature</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The BDS English and Literature in English curriculum aims to provide students
with the opportunity to acquire literary and linguistic skills so that
they will be able to communicate effectively as a result of their development
in the various areas of language competency.</p>
<p>The department curates texts and resources which are diverse to enable
our students to explore their own and others’ customs, traditions, values,
beliefs and ways of seeing and making sense of the world through readings
and discussions. The resources used by the department add to the relevance
and authenticity of the curriculum, allowing students to experience the
power of language.</p>

<h3>Approach &amp; Pedagogy</h3>
<p>The BDS English Language and Literature programme approaches the teaching
of texts thematically in alignment with the Instructional Materials from
Curriculum Planning &amp; Development Division (CPDD), with the intentional
use of CLEARR pedagogical strategies to encourage exploration of ideas,
reflection, and greater focus on the writing journey rather than just the
end product. Our lessons are designed based on the principles of e-pedagogy
and blended learning and the principles and processes of EL teaching and
learning. Teachers facilitate Assessment for Learning (AfL) in classrooms
to identify students’ readiness, interests and learning profiles and check
their progress. Our teachers adapt the instructional strategies to develop
students with different strengths and needs.</p>
