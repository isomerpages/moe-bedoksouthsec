Information on PDLP Onboarding
==============================

Digital technology is becoming increasingly pervasive in jobs, workplaces and society. The National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) was launched in March 2020 to make digital learning inclusive by equipping students with the digital literacies to be future-ready.  

  

Through the NDLP, all secondary school students will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD) by end 2021. Singapore Citizen students can use their Edusave Account to pay for the PLD. The device will be used to facilitate an environment that encourages personalised learning.
