<p>Since its beginnings, Chinese Orchestra has achieved much on its road
to perfection. There is a strong traditional culture within the CCA which
cultivates self-discipline in every child.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chinese Orchestra is a CCA that not only cultivates musical talents but
also inculcates strong discipline in every student. We promote virtues
of Chinese customs and values such as hardworking and perseverance through
appreciating the story behind every scores that we played.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being part of Bedok South Secondary School Chinese Orchestra (BDSCO) family
requires immense commitment and responsibility from each member of the
orchestra. With all the hard work and dedication from our students, we
achieve the Certificate of Distinction in Singapore Youth Festival Arts
Presentation 2021 and 2023.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>Students with no musical background get to learn the basics of music and
gained opportunities to perform. We look forward to the years ahead where
we will work harder and continue to pursue our passion for music and grow
stronger as a team. We welcome you to join us!</p>
