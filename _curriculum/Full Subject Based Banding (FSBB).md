<h3>Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB)</h3><p>Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) is part of MOE’s ongoing efforts to nurture the joy of learning and develop multiple pathways to cater to the different strengths and interests of our students.</p>

<p>With Full SBB, we are moving towards a secondary school education where students learn each subject at the level that best caters to their overall strengths, interests and learning needs.</p><p>Full SBB aims for students to: <br>1. Have <strong>greater ownership of their learning</strong> according to their strengths, interests, abilities, talents and learning needs <br>2. Develop a <strong>growth mindset and an intrinsic motivation</strong> to learn for life <br>3. Have <strong>more opportunities to interact with friends</strong> of different strengths, interests, abilities and talents <br>4. Have <strong>more options for post-secondary pathways</strong>, while ensuring they have strong fundamentals and can thrive in their chosen pathway</p><p>Thus, students who go through Full SBB will experience:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Mixed form classes upon entering secondary school</p></li><li><p>Greater flexibility to offer subjects at various subject levels</p></li><li><p>Shift away from stream-based subject offerings</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Common Curriculum Subjects</strong></h3><p>At lower secondary, students will take <strong>six common curriculum subjects</strong> with peers from their form class. These subjects are Art, Character &amp; Citizenship Education, Design &amp; Technology, Food &amp; Consumer Education, Music and Physical Education. These subjects take up approximately one-third of curriculum time, giving students time to interact with classmates of different strengths and interests.</p><p>For other subjects (English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics and/or Science), the subject level at the start of Secondary 1 is based on students’ PSLE Score and indicated by Posting Groups. Beyond the start of Secondary One, eligible students can take some subjects at a <strong>more or less demanding level (i.e. G1, G2 or G3)</strong> according to their strengths, interests and learning needs, at appropriate junctures if they meet the eligibility criteria. Students who offer subjects at a less demanding level may subsequently offer the subject at a more demanding level as they gain greater competence and confidence in the subject. The school will advise students accordingly based on holistic considerations.</p><p>At upper secondary, students will continue to have flexibility to offer subjects at different subject levels. Students may offer elective subjects (e.g. Additional Mathematics, Art, Design &amp; Technology) at a subject level suited to their strengths, interests and post-secondary aspirations. From 2027, students will sit for the new SEC examinations, with different papers for each subject level..</p><p>For more information on Full SBB, visit&nbsp;<a href="https://go.gov.sg/moe-fsbb" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/moe-fsbb</a>. <br></p><p>For more information on how our school will be implementing Full SBB, you can contact us at <a href="bsss@moe.edu.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">bsss@moe.edu.sg</a>.</p><p></p><h3>Offering Humanities subjects at a more demanding level</h3><p>Students will also be able to offer <strong>Humanities subjects</strong> (Geography, History, and Literature in English) at a more demanding level from Secondary Two. The criteria for taking Humanities at a more demanding level will be based on students' aptitude for and interest in these subjects at Secondary One.</p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="4"><p>Eligibility Criteria</p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Humanities subject level at S1</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Humanities Subject</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>School-based assessment</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Option to take Humanities at a more demanding level from Secondary Two</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>G2</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Geography</p></li><li><p>History</p></li><li><p>Literature in English</p></li></ul></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Aptitude and interest for specific subject</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>G3 Geography, History and/or Literature in English (i.e. can offer one or more Humanities subjects at a more demanding level)</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>G1</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Social Studies component</p></li><li><p>Humanities Exposure Modules (HEMs) in Geography, History and Literature in English</p></li></ul></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Aptitude in English Language and G1 Humanities</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>G2 Geography, History and/or Literature in English (i.e. can offer one or more Humanities subjects at a more demanding level)</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>

### Supporting your child
These are some things you can do to support your child through their secondary school journey:

1.	**Connect** with them: Create opportunities outside of school that would help you and your child recognise their interests, skills, strengths, learning styles and aspirations.
2.	**Support** them to learn for life: Stay open to the possible education and career pathways that are available and be flexible in discussing these pathways with them. Encourage them to take ownership of their goals and plans.
