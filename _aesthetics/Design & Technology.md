Design & Technology
===================

### Introduction

Design & Technology (D&T) is for lower and upper secondary levels (Express, Normal Academic and Normal Technical). In upper secondary, it is offered as an elective subject.

  

In D&T, students learn through design-and-make projects guided by a design process. The design process entails identifying design needs from real-world experiences, generating and developing ideas, and realising the design solution; with research carried out when necessary. Research includes testing ideas through quick mock-ups and evaluating the final design solution with the intended user. In doing so, students acquire related knowledge and develop skills to turn ideas into reality and values like mindfulness, empahty and sensitivity in the areas of social, culture and environment.

#### Lower Secondary Programme

The lower Secondary D&T programme provides tactile learning experiences for students to construct prototypes of developed idea and generate their interest in the D&T subject. It aims to:  

  

*   generate interest in learning through visual-spatial thinking, sketching, experimenting and prototyping  
    
*   develop and understanding of function, aesthetics and technology in design through everyday products and their implication on sustainability  
*   design appropriateness with respect to users, functionality and environment
*   develop confidence and pride through turning ideas into physical objects.

The knowledge, skills and values gained at this level lay the foundation for D&T learning at the upper secondary level.

#### Upper Secondary Programme

At upper secondary programme, designing and making are dealt with at a greater depth and scope. The focus is on understanding everyday activities to create products that make life better. In the process, students cultivate creativity, critical and reflective thinking. They develop design related dispositions and skills. It aims to:

*   develop confidence, pride and tenacity through exploring real world design opportunities for which ideas are developed
    
*   develop ideas based on the Physical, Intellectual and Emotional needs of the user in the environment
    
*   cultivate thinking through doodling and sketching
    
*   prototype making skills using appropriate materials and tools
    
*   do meaningful evaluation from evidence or data collected.
