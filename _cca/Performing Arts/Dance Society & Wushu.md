Dance Society/Wushu
=============

![](/images/Dance1.jpg)

The Dance Society has evolved since its establishment in 2012. Since 2020, it focuses on Chinese Dance and Wushu. Using the vision of 4Es – Experience, Enrich, Engage and Explore to plan its programmes, the Dance Society promises to develop its members holistically.

Besides experiencing the various movements in the Chinese Dance and Wushu, students’ experiences were further enriched when they participated in competitions and performances. The Dance Society achieved Certificate of Distinction in the 2021 SYF Arts Presentation in the Chinese Dance category and Wushu achieved different awards in the various events they competed in the National Wushu and Sanda competition 2021 and National School Games in 2021 and 2022. Students also performed yearly for the Chinese New Year concert in school and National Day Dinner at community centres.

To allow students to explore and enhance their passion in dance, programmes such as watching professional arts groups performances have been planned. CCA leaders also attended the yearly Ampliefied!DanceLab organized by Arts Education Branch. This helps them to explore their passion in dance as they interact with other students and professionals during this two-day course.

As members of the society, it is important to inculcate empathy and encourage students to actively engage with the community. Students participated yearly in Values-in-Action (VIA) activities. In 2022, students work with Thye Hua Kwan Bedok Radiance Seniors Activity Centre at Bedok South Road. They helped out by engaging and encouraging the elderly during their keep fit programme and packed food rations and distributed to the elderly in their respective HDB units.

SYF Achievements
================

On April 6, the Chinese Dance Society took part in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) 2021 Dance Arts Performance (AP). With Singapore still in Phase 3 of the nation’s Re-opening plans, participation in SYF 2021 proved to be more challenging than previous years with the Safety Management Measures (SMM) in place. It was challenging for the instructor to choreograph the dance for SYF 2021 with restrictions on the maximum number of dancers per group, the need to ensure a distance of 2m between participants, and having no part of the hand or face in contact with the dance mat.

Our dance titled “2020 and me” centres around the theme of the Covid-19 pandemic. The dance aims to show the isolation and frustration faced by many people in 2020. The girls started their practice early in January this year and had more intensive training sessions during the March holidays.

The hard work and effort the girls put in truly showed their commitment and determination. The students were elated that their effort had not been in vain when they received news that Chinese Dance Society had achieved the Certificate of Distinction for their performance.
