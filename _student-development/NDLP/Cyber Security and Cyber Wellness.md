<h1>Cyber Security and Cyber Wellness</h1>
<p>Device management application (DMA) software will be installed on your
child’s device to provide a safe learning experience for your child, and
to prevent misuse of the device.</p>
<p>The security software on students' PLD only collects information required
to facilitate a conducive environment for teaching and learning, and to
encourage good online practices.</p>
<p>The DMA has three main components which will support the use of PLD in
the classroom and safeguard students’ cyber wellness:</p>
<p><strong>(a) Classroom Management Service</strong>
</p>
<p>This enables teachers to manage the students’ use of the PLD during lesson
time to improve classroom management and support effective teaching and
learning.</p>
<p><strong>(b) Mobile Device Management Service</strong>
</p>
<p>This facilitates the updating and management of the PLDs, protects PLDs
from malicious software, and protects your child/ward from objectionable
internet content, or content that may not be conducive to teaching and
learning during school hours.</p>
<p><strong>(c) Usage Management Service</strong>
</p>
<p>This enables the school and/or parents/guardians to better supervise and
set helpful limits for students’ use of PLD after school.</p>
<p>The DMA will be funded by MOE and will be uninstalled from the device
when the child graduates/ leaves the school.</p>
<h3>Cyber Wellness Education</h3>
<p>As BDSians develop digital skills that support their learning, it is also
imperative that they are empowered to take responsibility for their personal
well-being when using technology.</p>

<p>The school adopts MOE’s Cyber Wellness Framework to develop students into
responsible digital citizens. BDSians’ attitudes and behaviour on the use
of technology are guided by the three Cyber Wellness Principles. These
principles are constantly reinforced when students engage in the “Sense-Think-Act”
process, which serves as a structure for them to use technology safely
and meaningfully for their learning and interactions.</p>
