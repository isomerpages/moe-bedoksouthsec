<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Football training in Bedok South Secondary provides the opportunity for
students to take time off from their school work to relax and have fun.
Even though our Coach, Ex-National Player, Dalis Supait enforces tough
training to ensure the players improve their fitness level and also their
technical skills, every session always ends with a game where players get
to pit their skills against one another resulting in much enjoyment for
all players.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to the nature of the training, the bonding between the soccer players
is tremendous. Players of the team, regardless of class, level, race and
religion have established great rapport both off and on the pitch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Character Building is another key aspect that the coach and the teachers
greatly emphasize during trainings and games. Discipline is strictly enforced
in the team to ensure everyone knows the expected behaviour to be carried
out in the team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With all these components infused, we believe that our CCA provides an
enriching and fulfilling experience for all our members.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Vision</h3>

<br>challenging environment.</p>
