Pedagogy Approach<br>
Inquiry-based learning lends itself well in FCE as the syllabus is experiential in nature. The school focus on three main domains – Engage, Explore and Apply.<br>

**Engage**
* Being provided an interesting context
* Carry out analytical &amp; critical thinking research work

**Explore**
* Students collaborate/ record thoughts
* Students ideate on possibilities

**Apply**
* Demonstrate knowledge/skills gain
* Evaluate own knowledge gain<br>

**Assessment Format (Upper Secondary)**<br>
The assessment objectives for this subject are classified into two main areas:<br>
 Paper 1 : 40 % (100 marks)<br>
 Paper 2 : 60 % (100 marks)<br>

 Section A: consisting of multiple-choice questions (15 marks)<br>
 Section B: consisting of short-answer-questions and data -response-type questions (55 marks)<br>
 Section C: consisting of open-ended questions (30 marks)<br>
Paper 2 – Coursework<br>
Candidates will be given an assignment at the beginning of the examination year which must be completed for assessment by end July or early August of the examination year. The assignment is a study which will require the candidates to apply their knowledge and understanding in relation to the subject content. The assignment requires a problem-solving and investigative approach, with an emphasis on experimental work. A total of 28 hours must be assigned during curriculum time to facilitate the completion of the assignment.
