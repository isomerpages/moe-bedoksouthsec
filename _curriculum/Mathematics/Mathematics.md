Mathematics
===========

### Introduction

The Mathematics Department aims to enthuse and empower students to learn and use mathematics in future engagements. We seek to develop confident and competent, self-directed learners and users of mathematical problem solving in the 21st Century.

### Student Outcomes

The&nbsp;<b>Additional Mathematics Syllabus</b>&nbsp;aims to enable&nbsp;students who have an aptitude and interest in mathematics to:

*   Acquire mathematical concepts and skills for higher studies in&nbsp;mathematics and to support learning in the other subjects, in&nbsp;particular, the sciences;  
    
*   Develop thinking, reasoning and meta-cognitive skills through a&nbsp;mathematical approach to problem-solving;  
    
*   Connect ideas within mathematics and between mathematics&nbsp;and the sciences through applications of mathematics; and  
    
*   Appreciate the abstract nature and power of mathematics.  
    

  

The&nbsp;<b>Mathematics Syllabus</b>&nbsp;aims to enable all students&nbsp;to:

*   Acquire mathematical concepts and skills for continuous&nbsp;learning in mathematics and to support learning in other&nbsp;subjects;
*   Develop thinking, reasoning, communication, application and&nbsp;metacognitive skills through a mathematical approach to&nbsp;problem-solving;&nbsp;
*   Connect ideas within mathematics and between mathematics&nbsp;and other subjects through applications of mathematics;&nbsp;
*   Build confidence and foster interest in mathematics.

  

The&nbsp;<b>N(T) Mathematics Syllabus</b>&nbsp;aims to enable students who are bound&nbsp;for post-secondary vocational education&nbsp;to:  

*   Acquire mathematical concepts and&nbsp;skills for real life, to support learning&nbsp;in other subjects, and to prepare for&nbsp;vocational education;&nbsp;
*   Develop thinking, reasoning,&nbsp;communication, application and&nbsp;metacognitive skills through a&nbsp;mathematical approach to problem&nbsp;solving; and&nbsp;  
    
*   Build confidence in using&nbsp;mathematics and appreciate its&nbsp;value in making informed decisions&nbsp;in real life.



### Mathematics Learning Journeys &amp; Learning Experiences

In our effort towards student-centric, values-driven education, we want to nurture engaged learners who are motivated and enjoy learning. One of the areas to make every student an engaged learner is to ignite the joy of learning. This can be achieved in many means. We chose Experiential Learning.

Learning Journeys and Learning Experiences are designed for students to have the opportunities to apply knowledge and skills learnt in class in real-life contexts. We have evolved to integrate more subjects into these learning journeys.

Through these learning experiences, our students learn to realise the relevance of their lessons in school and have developed renewed enthusiasm and drive to greater achievement in school.
Through this all, our students see meaningful learning of Mathematics and Problem solving in the real world.

Our Secondary 3NT students embarked on an enlightening Learning Journey to the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) of Singapore, immersing themselves in a lesson enriched with map scales, statistical diagrams, population comparisons, and 3D objects. 

Engaging in hands-on activities, they skillfully wielded the 'Measure' app on their iPads and interacted with dynamic displays, unraveling the complexities of map representation and scale manipulation.

Leveraging on the use of Classkick, students instantly verified their answers and received constructive feedback, enhancing their methodological prowess. This immersive educational experience bestows upon them not just mathematical proficiency but also a profound appreciation for the practical applications of Mathematics in the real world.

### ICAN

In reaching out to the under-achievers in a Mathematics class, the ICAN principles were adopted this year in the Normal Technical and Normal Academic classes to better meet these students’ needs.

Using the 8 Principles as a guide, the teacher carefully designs his/ her teaching package to deliver a more effective lesson. The lesson may comprise of good learning experiences such as the use of manipulatives and focus on a real-life context.&nbsp;

The unique feature of the ICAN framework is the mentoring aspect. The mentor who is assigned to the teacher will provide feedback on the lesson design, sits in for the lesson observation and conducts the post lesson conference. During the post lesson conference, students’ learning gaps or misconceptions that were observed would be discussed further.&nbsp;

Although this project requires massive manpower and careful deployment, it has been worthwhile as both the teachers and students have benefitted much from it.&nbsp;

Students’ feedback on the lessons was encouraging while teachers felt that they became more reflective and effective in delivering a good lesson.&nbsp;
