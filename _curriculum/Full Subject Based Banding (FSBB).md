<h3>Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB)</h3>
<p>Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) is part of MOE’s ongoing efforts
to nurture the joy of learning and develop multiple pathways to cater to
the different strengths and interests of our students.</p>
<p>With Full SBB, we are moving towards a secondary school education where
students learn each subject at the level that best caters to their overall
strengths, interests and learning needs.</p>
<p>Full SBB aims for students to:
<br>1. Have <strong>greater ownership of their learning</strong> according to
their strengths, interests, abilities, talents and learning needs
<br>2. Develop a <strong>growth mindset and an intrinsic motivation</strong> to
learn for life
<br>3. Have <strong>more opportunities to interact with friends</strong> of
different strengths, interests, abilities and talents
<br>4. Have <strong>more options for post-secondary pathways</strong>, while
ensuring they have strong fundamentals and can thrive in their chosen pathway</p>
<p>Thus, students who go through Full SBB will experience:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Mixed form classes upon entering secondary school</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Greater flexibility to offer subjects at various subject levels</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shift away from stream-based subject offerings</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Common Curriculum Subjects</strong></h3>
<p>At lower secondary, students will take <strong>six common curriculum subjects</strong> with
peers from their form class. These subjects are Art, Character &amp; Citizenship
Education, Design &amp; Technology, Food &amp; Consumer Education, Music
and Physical Education. These subjects take up approximately one-third
of curriculum time, giving students time to interact with classmates of
different strengths and interests.</p>
<p>For other subjects (English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics
and/or Science), the subject level at the start of Secondary 1 is based
on students’ PSLE Score and indicated by Posting Groups. Beyond the start
of Secondary One, eligible students can take some subjects at a <strong>more or less demanding level (i.e. G1, G2 or G3)</strong> according
to their strengths, interests and learning needs, at appropriate junctures
if they meet the eligibility criteria. Students who offer subjects at a
less demanding level may subsequently offer the subject at a more demanding
level as they gain greater competence and confidence in the subject. The
school will advise students accordingly based on holistic considerations.</p>
<p>At upper secondary, students will continue to have flexibility to offer
subjects at different subject levels. Students may offer elective subjects
(e.g. Principles of Accounts, Art, Design &amp; Technology) at a subject
level suited to their strengths, interests and post-secondary aspirations.
From 2027, students will sit for the new SEC examinations, with different
papers for each subject level.</p>

<h3>Offering Humanities subjects at a more demanding level</h3>
<p>Students will also be able to offer <strong>Humanities subjects</strong> (Geography,
History, and Literature in English) at a more demanding level from Secondary
Two. The criteria for taking Humanities at a more demanding level will
be based on students' aptitude for and interest in these subjects at Secondary
One.</p>

<h3>Supporting your child</h3>
<p>These are some things you can do to support your child through their secondary
school journey:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Connect</strong> with them: Create opportunities outside of school
that would help you and your child recognise their interests, skills, strengths,
learning styles and aspirations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support</strong> them to learn for life: Stay open to the possible
education and career pathways that are available and be flexible in discussing
these pathways with them. Encourage them to take ownership of their goals
and plans.</p>
</li>
</ol>
