<h1>Principles of Accounts</h1>
<h3>Aims</h3>
<p>The primary aim of the POA syllabus is to develop in students the knowledge
and skills to prepare, communicate, and use both accounting information
and non-accounting information related to business to make decisions.</p>
<p>The syllabus then aims to help students to become users of accounting
information and make informed decisions using both accounting and non-accounting
business-related information. Students will learn and understand the following:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>What business decisions are,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How decisions are made using accounting information,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The limitations of relying only on accounting information, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The consideration of non-accounting business-related information.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<br>On 10 July 2025, BDS proudly hosted the National Financial Literacy Challenge
for the second consecutive year! 🎉</p>
<p>Jointly organised by the East Zone Principles of Accounts Networked Learning
Community (EZ POA NLC) and the Central Provident Fund Board (CPFB), with
strong support from the CPDD Commerce Unit, this nationwide event brought
together an amazing 395 students from 42 schools across Singapore.</p>
<p>This unique platform enabled our Secondary Three POA students across Singapore
to:
<br>📘 Observe the real-world relevance between POA and Financial Literacy
<br>🧠 Apply their POA knowledge to make sense of financial concepts
<br>📊 Understand the importance of financial planning for the future</p>
<p>Throughout the day, we witnessed students displaying the following competencies:
<br>💬 Adaptive thinking, critical thinking and computational thinking
<br>🤝 Teamwork and collaboration
<br>🧩 Interpersonal communication
<br>🔥 Dispositions, such as tenacity, meticulousness, and curiosity</p>
<p>🙌 A special shout-out to our very own inaugural cohort of 30 BDS Game
Testers and Facilitators (Sec 3 POA students), who stepped up to support
this national platform to advocate for the importance of financial literacy!
<br>Together, we are building not just financial literacy, but also future-ready,
socially responsible learners.</p>
<p>❤️ A big thank you to all educators, partners, and supporters who made
this meaningful experience possible. Let’s continue to ignite learning,
inspire confidence, and invest in our students’ future!❤️

<p>
<br>On 10 July (Thu), our Sec 3Integrity POA students transformed one corner
of the school canteen into a pop-up marketplace — but more than that, they
turned it into a space filled with purpose, compassion, and community spirit.</p>
<p>Driven by a desire to apply their business and accounting knowledge for
good, these young changemakers ran a Charity Sales Drive in support of
Children’s Cancer Foundation and Jamiyah Home for the Aged. From sweets
to DIY bear painting kits, from adorable plushies to pre-loved treasures
— every item told a story of kindness, effort, and heart.</p>
<p>📚💡 Beyond sales revenue, profit, and sales techniques, they learnt the
true bottom line: Making a Meaningful Difference and Embracing the Sense
of Possibilities.</p>
<p>We are incredibly proud of their initiative, grit, and empathy. And we
are deeply thankful to all staff and students who supported the cause —
whether by dropping by, making a purchase, offering a word of encouragement,
or simply sharing a smile. ❤️</p>
<p>This was more than a project. It was a movement — of youth rising up to
serve, to give, and to grow.</p>

to care and lead with heart.</p>
