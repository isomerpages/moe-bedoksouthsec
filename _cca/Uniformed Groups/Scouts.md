The Scout Movement is an integral partner that helps its members build character and leadership. Scouting offers an informal education to develop individuals for purposeful and responsible adulthood. The Scout Method is a comprehensive framework composed of key elements that work together as a system to provide young people with a rich and active learning environment, taking into account their evolving characteristics, needs and interests at different stages.

### Mission of Scouting
The mission of Scouting is to contribute to the education of young people, through a value system based on the Scout Promise and Law, to help build a better world where people are self-fulfilled as individuals and play a constructive role in society. This objective is achieved by:
<br>•	involving them throughout their formative years in a non-formal educational process
<br>•	using a specific method that makes each individal the principal agent of his or her development as a self-reliant, supportive, responsible and committed person
<br>•	assisting them to establish a value system based upon spiritual, social and personal principles as expressed in the Promise and Law


### Vision of Scouting

Better Scouting for more Young People

### The Scout Promise

On my Honour, I promise that I will do my best

<br>To help other people and
<br>To keep the Scout Law


### The Scout Law
A Scout is to be trusted
<br>A Scout is loyal
<br>A Scout makes friends, establishes and maintains harmonious relations
<br>A Scout is disciplined and considerate
<br>A Scout has courage in all difficulties


### Kijang Scout Group
“Try and leave this world a little better than you found it, and when your turn comes to die, you can die happy in feeling that at any rate, you have not wasted your time but have done your best.” – Lord Baden Powell, the founder of the Scout movement.

<br>It is our aspiration that the life skills taught will prepare our Scouts for the future and to become useful individuals to society. The quest for continuous learning is evident in Kijang Scout Group as our Scouts expand their knowledge through a wide range of programmes each year. The highlight comprises the East Area Scout Leadership Course (SLC), whereby Scouts from Secondary Three hone their leadership skills through a series of activities at East Spring Secondary School. The youths treasured the bond that has been forged with members of various troops in the East Area.

<br>To strengthen the message of a non-formal, value-based educational youth programme, our Scouts have embarked on a four-year project starting in 2022 and culminating in the celebration of Singapore’s Diamond Jubilee in 2025. The Diamond Jubilee Challenge (DJC) is a youth-led and adult-supported initiative where our Scouts will be immersed in meaningful learning journeys and community engagement activities.

<br>In addition, Job Week 2023 was a key educational experience for all Scouts. The main purpose of the Job Week, an annual fund-raising event, is to inculcate in Scouts the dignity of labour, the value of honest work and to help others, which will enable the Scouts to be better leaders and citizens of tomorrow. The concept of service before self; service to the community and the nation is an important aspect of the Scout Programme. Our Scouts performed jobs such as cleaning the corridor, taking away food, sorting out recyclables and watering the plants, which have helped them to appreciate the relentless efforts of our frontline workers such as town council cleaners and food delivery riders when our Scouts stayed home during the phases of circuit breaker.

<br>The Frank Cooper Sands Award (FCSA) for 2020 and 2021 was suspended due to the outbreak of Coronavirus in 2019 (COVID-19). Nevertheless, the Senior Patrol Leaders played their integral roles steadfastly in enabling our troop to attain the FCSA – Gold for 2022. Equipped with a solid platform for its pursuit of excellence, Kijang Scout Group will strive to groom the next batch of tenderfoots in the true spirit of Scouting.
