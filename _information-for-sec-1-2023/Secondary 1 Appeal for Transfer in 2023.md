Secondary 1 Appeal for Transfer in 2023
=======================================

School admissions are based on merit in the Secondary 1 Posting Exercise. Primary 6 students who have applied to Bedok South Secondary School during MOE’s Secondary 1 Posting Exercise but are unsuccessful, may appeal to be considered for transfer to the school. To submit the appeal, you will have to meet the school’s cut-off point (COP).
