Orientation Programme and CCA Fair 2023
=======================================

The transition to a secondary school can be an overwhelming experience for many Secondary One students but the experience can be made rewarding when students familiarise themselves with the rules, expectations and basic information of the school. 

To assist the students in making this transition, we have organised the following:

1\.  Orientation Programme: 3 Jan – 5 January 2023 (Tuesday to Thursday) <br>
2\.  CCA Fair: 6 January 2023 (Friday)


### Orientation Programme

<b>Objectives of the Orientation Programme</b>

*   To welcome our new BDSians into our BDS family
*   To create new friendships and bonds with classmates and Form Teachers (FTs)
*   To create a sense of belonging to the school with new environment and phase of life
*   To start the development of class identity through team building programmes and activities to build a strong sense of belonging to the school
*   To acquaint the Sec 1 students with the school’s rules and regulations, culture, and routines
