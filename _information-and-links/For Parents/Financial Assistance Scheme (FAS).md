Singapore Citizens in financial need can get assistance from MOE on school fees and other expenses. This applies to government, government-aided, specialised and some independent schools. *Learn* if your child is eligible. 

  

Students who are unable to print the form at home may collect the [FAS application](/files/MOE_FAS_Application_Form-30_Sep_2020.pdf) from the General Office.

They strongly advised to bring all the relevant documents needed when they come down to the General Office:

a. CPF Transaction Statement or Contribution History for past 12 months.

b. Latest Income Tax Notice of Assessment (for both employed and self-employed household member(s)).

• If the self-employed household member is not required to pay tax or the latest tax assessment does not reflect his or her current income status, the member is to complete an additional declaration at Section A of Annex II.

c. Latest payslip or a letter from the employer certifying gross monthly income (applicable only for employed household member(s)).

d. Proof of other sources of income (e.g. rental, pension, and etc), if applicable.

e. Declaration of unemployment (if applicable).

• For household members who are unemployed and below age 62 and are not undertaking full-time studies or undergoing full-time National Service – to complete declaration at Section B of Annex II.

f. Student/Matriculation card for full-time student at tertiary institutions (e.g. ITE, Polytechnics, Universities, private schools) / Identification card for full-time National Servicemen (if applicable).

g. Copies of NRIC of household members, other than parents and unmarried siblings of the child. If there are other dependent children without NRIC, please submit copies of legal documents to show that they are staying in the same address.

h. Where applicable, documents showing proof of legal guardianship (e.g. a court order or Letters of Probate or Administration), for the purposes of Section VI of the application form.

i. Any other documents as and when required by the school for the purpose of verifying the income.

Students or their parents may submit the completed form along with all the necessary documents when they come down to the school to collect their books and school uniform on the allocated date and time. The school will issue them the FAS Approval Letter upon receiving the form and documents. Parents or students will have to show the FAS Approval Letter to the bookshop or the uniform vendor.

P6 parents or students who have applied for FAS from their primary school will receive a notification via Parents’ Gateway from Bedok South Secondary after the release of Sec 1 posting. Thus, parents are highly encouraged to download the Parents’ Gateway app on their phone.

Those who are successful in their FAS application, may also consider applying for a new computer under the NEU PC Plus programme. They can download the *M1-IMDA Fibre Broadband Service Application Form* and *PC-Bundle Application Form*. However, please note that each eligible household may apply for one subsidized computer once every 3 years, regardless of the number of school-going children or household members with permanent disabilities.
