Cyber Security and Cyber Wellness
=================================

Device management application (DMA) software will be installed on your child’s device to provide a safe learning experience for your child, and to prevent misuse of the device.

  

The security software on students' PLD only collects information required to facilitate a conducive environment for teaching and learning, and to encourage good online practices.

  

The DMA has three main components which will support the use of PLD in the classroom and safeguard students’ cyber wellness:

  


<b>(a) Classroom Management Service</b>



  

This enables teachers to manage the students’ use of the PLD during lesson time to improve classroom management and support effective teaching and learning.

  



<b>(b) Mobile Device Management Service</b>



  

This facilitates the updating and managing of the PLD, protects the PLD from malicious software, and protects students from objectionable internet content.

  



<b>(c) Usage Management Service</b>



  

This enables the school and/or parents/guardians to better supervise and set helpful limits for students’ use of PLD after school.

  

The DMA will be funded by MOE and will be uninstalled from the device when the child graduates/ leaves the school.

### Cyber Wellness Education

As BDSians develop digital skills that support their learning, it is also imperative that they are empowered to take responsibility for their personal well-being when using technology.

The school adopts MOE’s Cyber Wellness Framework to develop students into responsible digital citizens. BDSians’ attitudes and behaviour on the use of technology are guided by the three Cyber Wellness Principles. These principles are constantly reinforced when students engage in the “Sense-Think-Act” process, which serves as a structure for them to use technology safely and meaningfully for their learning and interactions.
