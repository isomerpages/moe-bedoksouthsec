<h1>Orientation Programme and CCA Fair 2025</h1>
<h3>Secondary One Orientation</h3>
<p>The purpose of the Secondary One Orientation is to help our new students
transition smoothly into their secondary school journey by building a sense
of belonging, confidence, and excitement for the years ahead.
<br>Through a series of carefully designed activities, students will get to
know their peers, familiarise themselves with the school environment, values,
and routines, and understand the expectations of secondary school life.
<br>This orientation aims to cultivate friendships, encourage teamwork, and
provide guidance, ensuring that each student feels welcomed and prepared
to embark on this new phase of their educational journey with a positive
and open mindset.
<br>
</p>
<p>To assist the students in making this transition, we have organised the
following:</p>

<br>
<br><strong>Selection Trials and CCA Experience</strong>
<br>Selected CCAs will be conducting <strong>selection trials</strong> as well
as <strong>CCA experience</strong> to allow the students to find out more
about the CCA they may be interested in. The trials and CCA experience
will be held on the <strong>6, 8, and 13 January 2025</strong>. The <strong>details of the trials and CCA experience</strong> will
be announced on the <strong>first week of school and posted on the CCA noticeboard </strong>(outside
the HOD room). Those who sign up for the trials will be given priority
during the Secondary 1 CCA selection (<strong>subject to vacancies available</strong>).
<br>
<br>Students who are admitted by DSA need not sign up for the trials as their
names are already in the respective CCA lists.</p>
