Music
=====

### Introduction

![Music](/images/music.jpg)

In the music programme at BDS, students listen to, compose and perform music from a broad range of styles, traditions and contexts. They create, shape and share sounds in time and space and critically analyze music they listen to, make and perform. Music practice is aurally based and focuses on acquiring and using knowledge, to understand music and musicians from their own experience and from other times and places.
 
#### Student Outcomes


The General Music Programme aims to:

\- Develop awareness andappreciation of music in local and global cultures

\- Develop ability for creative expression and communication through music-making

\- Provide the basis to develop an informed and life-long involvement in music


#### Curriculum

The curriculum refers tocontent and learning experiences that support the acquisition of the above  

student outcomes. The key features of the curriculum comprise learning goals

and content, pedagogy and assessment.

#### Learning Goals and Content

Music is conducted semestrally for all lower secondary students. Students acquire basic instrument

skills in electronic music keyboards and guitar in order to develop their interests and passion. These skills serve as a platform for group music-making, songwriting and performance opportunities. Resources are provided for students to continue their learning outside of the classroom.

  

Students are exposed to specialised music software to add relevance to their learning in today’s increasingly digital world. These include music production software to facilitate creative and performance endeavours within the school and community.

Upper secondary students with formal training and background are encouraged to pursue ‘O’ Level Music at designated music centres. Please refer to the syllabus above for details of learning goals and content.

#### Pedagogy

The department has applied the informal and non-formal pedagogical approach (Green, 2008) based on the practices of popular musicians. This approach emphasizes student-directed, peer-directed and group learning, in order to develop greater ownership and to express creative musical ideas in collaborative music making. The non-formal approach allows for differentiated learning in a group setting as students perform to their abilities, based on different instrument competencies. 

#### Assessment

Music achievement standards indicate the quality of learning that students should typically demonstrate.
The sequence of achievement describes progress in the learning area, and provides students a framework of growth and learning in the subject. Students are also assessed on subject-specific terminology and organisation that reflects the essential characteristics of learning with the subject.


Student portfolios of creative work illustrate the expected learning and help teachers to make judgments about whether students have achieved the standard at each level.
