Level Camps for "Grow Week"
===========================

BDS embarked on a coordinated&nbsp;school-wide programme where all levels went&nbsp;through 3 days of camp throughout Singapore in&nbsp;the second week of Term 1 from 13-15 Jan. The&nbsp;Sec 1s had Camp Unity which was an orientation&nbsp;camp while the Sec 2s had Camp Challenge, an adventure camp at Jalan Bahtera Outdoor Adventure Learning Centre. As for the Sec 3s, they had&nbsp;Camp Endeavour with expeditions taking them to&nbsp;various parts of the island. The Sec 4s and 5s had&nbsp;‘Camp Success’ which was a personal development&nbsp;programme to prepare for their national examinations ahead.

 <b>Sec 1 Camp Unity:</b>
 <br>Camp Unity was a 3-day 2-night residential camp&nbsp;programme conducted in school. About 275 Sec 1&nbsp;students attended this camp along with 30 Sec 2&nbsp;prefects and peer leaders who helped to organise&nbsp;the camp. Their form teachers stayed with them&nbsp;throughout the camp, strengthening bonds with&nbsp;their form classes. Students participated in activities that developed their class spirit and identity.&nbsp;The highlight of the camp was the campfire where&nbsp;a huge screen was constructed at the quadrangle&nbsp;displaying the amazing campfire.
 

<b>Sec 2 Camp Challenge:</b>
<br>Camp Resilience was conducted at Jalan Bahtera&nbsp;located at the western end of Singapore. There&nbsp;they participated in adventure activities like abseiling, high and low ropes courses, caving and an&nbsp;expedition to Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve. The&nbsp;students were placed outside their comfort zone&nbsp;and they had to overcome the individual and group&nbsp;challenges placed before them. They were led also&nbsp;by Sec 3 prefects and peer leaders in the activities.

  

<b>Sec 3 Camp Endeavour:</b>
<br>Camp Endeavour was a series of three expeditions.&nbsp;The first was a 8km long orienteering trail at Pasir&nbsp;Ris Park. Students get to practise their navigation&nbsp;skills. The second was a 11km trail around&nbsp;MacRitchie Reservoir where the students navigated themselves around the Nature Reserve of&nbsp;MacRitchie Reservoir, the Central Catchment Area&nbsp;and the Tree Top Walk. The third expedition was&nbsp;the Southern Ridges Trail which was about 12km&nbsp;long. There they walked up and down Telok Blangah Hill, Mt Faber and crossed the beautiful Henderson Waves Bridge ending the hike at HortPark.

<b>Sec 4 Camp Success:</b>
<br>
Camp Success had the Sec 4s and 5s undergoing&nbsp;training sessions to develop their time management skills and life skills needed to chart their&nbsp;future. They had courses in resume writing and&nbsp;interview skills to help prepare them for their&nbsp;future. They also had sessions where they discover&nbsp;and explore their future education and careers.
<br><br>Overall the camps marked a good start for each of&nbsp;the levels. These set a good tone and signalled a&nbsp;good start for the year ahead for all.

CCA Fair and Aesthetics Showcase
================================

The annual CCA Fair and Aesthetics showcase&nbsp;held on 22 Jan 2016 provided Sec 1 students and&nbsp;their parents an opportunity to explore and engage with members of the various CCAs. The&nbsp;groups participating in the showcase comprised&nbsp;the Choir, Chinese Orchestra, Symphonic Band,&nbsp;Malay Dance Ensemble and Dance Society. In the&nbsp;performance segment, the audience were given a glimpse of the intended outcomes of Performing&nbsp;Arts CCAs. Parents were able to observe how&nbsp;participation in these CCAs could develop their&nbsp;children’s musical or dance skills. The competency in the various art forms displayed by our students also gave parents an insight into the performance character values that would be cultivated&nbsp;through these CCAs, specifically perseverance,&nbsp;diligence and responsibility. The performances&nbsp;were well-received and certainly inspired many to&nbsp;join these CCAs.
<br><br>In the parade segment, the Guest-of-Honour&nbsp;gracing the occasion was the Vice-Chairperson of&nbsp;our Parent Support Group, Ms Florence Chan,&nbsp;while the Guard-of-Honour was our National Civil&nbsp;Defence Cadet Corps. They were supported by&nbsp;our other Uniformed Groups - NCC (Land), NPCC,&nbsp;Scouts and Guides. Collectively, they demonstrated the resilience, leadership qualities and life&nbsp;skills that had been acquired from all their training sessions. The combined UG parade certainly&nbsp;wowed many among the crowds.
<br><br>The Physical Sports groups also displayed their&nbsp;training routines and skills at their respective&nbsp;booths to the budding sporting talents while the&nbsp;clubs and societies showcased their projects to&nbsp;students who might want to develop their areas&nbsp;of specific interests.&nbsp;With the school’s CCA vision for all students to be&nbsp;<b>BDSians of exemplary Character and Abilities</b>, it is&nbsp;hoped that the preview of all the Co-Curricular&nbsp;Activities available has helped the Sec 1s make a&nbsp;more well-informed decision on their choice of&nbsp;CCA. The Sec 1 students commenced CCAs from&nbsp;29 January onwards.
