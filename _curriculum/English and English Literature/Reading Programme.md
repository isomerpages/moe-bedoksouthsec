Reading Programme
=================

The Reading Programme encourages students to discover the joy in reading through scheduled library visits and also book recommendations by teachers or peers. Students in our school are encouraged to read as widely as possible from our physical collection at Oasis@BDS (school library). With the implementation of the PLD programme in 2022, students are further encouraged to use their devices to tap on the digital resources that are available on the NLB website and also via our morning reading website ‘Take Your Pick!’ with materials that are curated according to themes, students’ interest and profiles. Through monthly library activities which are organised in tandem with various stakeholders, we hope to engage our students in thematic activities and learn new skills. We aim to nurture our students to be life-long readers and continue to develop multi perspectives, global awareness and critical thinking skills.

The programme aims to:

(i)  Develop lifelong readers by encouraging students to read and view critically and with accuracy, understanding and appreciation of a wide array of print and digital materials.

(ii)  Widen students’ horizons of the world around them.

(iii) Learn new skills through library activities.
