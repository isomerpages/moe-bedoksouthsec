<h1>Character and Citizenship Education &nbsp;</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Bedok South Secondary takes a whole school approach towards Student Development
with every teacher, a Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) teacher.
The school aims to develop our students’ knowledge, understanding, skills
and abilities to make informed and responsible choices in their lives.
CCE seeks to achieve the BDS vision to:</p>

<h3>Approach and Pedagogy</h3>
<p>The BDS CCE experience comprises the following areas:</p>
<h5><strong>CCE Lessons</strong></h5>
<p>CCE lessons are opport unities for teachers to facilitate learning for
building positive character and citizenry. The lessons across all levels
(secondary 1 to 5) are taught according to the following themes</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The Leader Within</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Family Our Foundation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being a Positive Influence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>U &amp; I in the Community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is Home Truly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thinking Hearts, Feeling Minds</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To develop social and emotional competencies in students, the following
programmes are incorporated into CCE lessons:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Education and Career Guidance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sexuality Education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cyber Wellness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Values in Action</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>CCE lessons are also a platform to deliver the National Education (NE)
experience.</p>
<h5><strong>School-Based CCE</strong></h5>
<p>To enhance the development of positive character and values, morning assemblies
are platforms for talks and sharing by staff and students. Three times
a week, presentations during morning assemblies focus on the following
themes:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><em>Values Monday</em> : Staff and students link the BDS ICARE Values to
stories, articles and their personal experiences to inculcate in students
the values of Integrity, Courage, Accountability, Respect, Excellence and
Care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>CCE Wednesday</em> : Sharing by staff and students on Character and
Citizenship Education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Excellence Friday</em> : To encourage students to strive for excellence
in all they do, student achievements are recognised and students are given
the opportunity to share their learning on their journey to success.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, customised assembly programmes are planned throughout the
year to compliment the lessons taught during CCE lessons.</p>
<h5><strong>Teacher-Pupil Interviews</strong></h5>
<p>Form Teachers conduct Teacher-Pupil Interview (TPI) sessions with students
to build rapport and identify their needs and strengths. Students are encouraged
to take this opportunity to get to know their Form Teachers better and
share with them their concerns and aspirations. TPI sessions are conducted
during dedicated curriculum time.</p>
<h5><strong>Student Recognition</strong></h5>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/awards-scholarships/edusave-awards" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">EdusaveCharacter Award (ECHA)</a>&nbsp;aims
to recognise Singaporean students in the school who are exemplary in character
and possess outstanding personal qualities through their behaviour and
actions which inspire others. This award is given to a maximum of 2% of
Singaporean students in the school at the end of the year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ECHA recipients are selected based on school-based criteria that are based
on guidelines provided by MOE. Students are identified for consistently
demonstrating civic responsibility, resilience and values that BDS wishes
to recognise and encourage.</p>
