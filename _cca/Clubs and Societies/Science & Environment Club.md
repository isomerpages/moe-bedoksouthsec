Science &amp; Environment Club
==========================


### Overview

The Science and Environment Club nurtures students' knowledge and thinking about scientific and environmental issues. It aims to develop students' interest in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) and equip them with baseline skills necessary to pursue a career in STEM. 

The club seeks student opinions and feedback, and tailors programmes to cater to their learning needs each year. In the course of 2023, the club has run the following science modules for the students:

* Introduction to Microscopy Using Leaves from the Garden
* Introduction to Titration Using Vitamin C and Iodine
* Making Plastic Out of Milk
* Introduction to Nature-journaling of Plants in the Garden
* Party Science: Balloon-sculpting and the Reaction of Mentos with Coke
* Chemistry of Chocolate @ Science Centre
* Molecular Gastronomy @ Science Centre
* Learning Journey @ NEWater Visitor Centre
* Intermediate Nature-journaling of Birds @ Bird Paradise
* Inter-Pentangular Competition @ St Hilda's Secondary School
* Visit and Experience @ The Gem Museum
