<h1>2026 Secondary One Orientation Programme and CCA Fair</h1>
<h3>Secondary One Orientation</h3>
<p>The purpose of the Secondary One Orientation is to help our new students
transition smoothly into their secondary school journey by building a sense
of belonging, confidence, and excitement for the years ahead.
<br>Through a series of carefully designed activities, students will get to
know their peers, familiarise themselves with the school environment, values,
and routines, and understand the expectations of secondary school life.
<br>This orientation aims to cultivate friendships, encourage teamwork, and
provide guidance, ensuring that each student feels welcomed and prepared
to embark on this new phase of their educational journey with a positive
and open mindset.
<br>
</p>
<p>To assist the students in making this transition, we have organised the
following:</p>
