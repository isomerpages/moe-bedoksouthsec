<h3>Activities</h3>
<p><strong>A) Parades</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>I. NPCC Annual Parade</strong>
</p>
<p>The NPCC Annual Parade (NPAP) is the flagship event in the NPCC calendar.
It marks the celebration of the NPCC Day and is also the day for the NPCC
to honour the outstanding achievements of its units. It also aims to instil
loyalty in the cadets &amp; dedication to the Corps. The participation
would be formed by all school representatives.</p>
<p><strong>II. National Day Parade</strong>
</p>
<p>The Singapore National Day Parade is a national ceremony to commemorate
Singapore’s independence on 9th&nbsp;August. Every year, NPCC will form
one supporting contingent in the National Day Parade. Our supporting contingent
is made up of selected cadets from various units.</p>
<p><strong>B) Competitions</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>I. Inter-Unit Annual .22 Revolver Shooting Competition</strong>
</p>
<p>NPCC organises .22 Revolver Shooting Competition for its cadets annually.
All units are invited to nominate a maximum of two teams of cadets to take
part in the competition. Each team will comprise 5 cadets selected from
Sec 3, 4, or 5 who must have participated in the Sec 3 Classification shoot
prior to the competition. Eligible participants from the Preliminary Rounds
would vie for the Championship Trophy in the Finals. The competition is
held at Home Team Academy (HTA) Range.</p>
<p><strong>II. NPCC Campcraft Competition</strong>
</p>
<p>The Campcraft Competition is held once every two years. It alternates
with the Inter-Unit Drill Competition.</p>
<p>There will be two categories in the competition: Boys’ Team and Girls’
Team. Competing teams were assessed on their abilities to apply campcraft
skills in a standard set of components. The purpose of the competition
is to promote efficiency in conducting outdoor activities and to encourage
team-spirit among cadets.</p>
<p><strong>III. Inter-Unit Drill</strong>
</p>
<p>The drill competition is organised for all NPCC units annually. The competition
aims to assess cadets’ proficiency in drills on a pre-determined set of
competition criteria and to instil the qualities of innovation and enterprise
amongst cadets.</p>
<p><strong>C) Activities</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>I. Beyond our Shoes (OEV)</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>OEV Hong Kong and OEV Sabah</strong>
</p>
<p>NPCC organises annual educational visits for our cadets and members. NPCC
cadets and members have the opportunity to network, not just locally, but
into foreign lands as well.</p>
<p>NPCC made its inaugural visit to RBPF and Brunei Police Cadet Corps in
May 2011. Thereafter, NPCC continue to make its second visit to the RBPF
and the Brunei Police Cadet Corps from 21 – 25 May 2012. The visit programmes
include exchanges between SPF and RBPF and the two Police Cadet Corps.
The cadets from both sides will have the opportunity to meet, interact
and learn from each other.</p>
<p><strong>II. Bi-annual Combined UG Camp: Harmony Camp</strong>
</p>
<p>The purpose of the visit is to broaden the mental horizon of our cadets
and members through first-hand knowledge of the economic, social and cultural
aspects of the host country. The educational visits focus mainly on regional
Asian countries that have similar set-up as the NPCC so that our cadets
are further exposed to the Police-Youth partnership programme in other
countries.</p>
