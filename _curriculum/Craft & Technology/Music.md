Music
=====

### Introduction
In the music programme at BDS, students listen to, compose and perform music from a broad range of styles, traditions and contexts. They create, shape and share sounds in time and space and critically analyze music they listen to, make and perform. Music practice is aurally based and focuses on acquiring and using knowledge, to understand music and musicians from their own experience and from other times and places.
 
#### Student Outcomes
The General Music Programme aims to: <br>
* Develop awareness and appreciation of music in local and global cultures<br>
* Develop ability for creative expression and communication through music-making<br>
* Provide the basis to develop an informed and life-long involvement in music

#### Curriculum
BDS Music Programme is conducted throughout the year for all lower secondary students. Students acquire basic instrument skills in electronic music keyboards and guitar in order to develop their interests and passion. These skills serve as a platform for group music-making, songwriting and performance opportunities. Resources are provided for students to continue their learning outside of the classroom.<br>

Students are exposed to specialised music software to add relevance to their learning in today’s increasingly digital world. These include music production software to facilitate creative and performance endeavours within the school and community.<br>
