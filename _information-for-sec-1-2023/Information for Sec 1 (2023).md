Information for Sec 1 (2023)
============================

Congratulations on your posting to Bedok South Secondary School. We are happy to welcome you to the BDSian family to commence your secondary school education.

  

This year, the incoming Sec 1 students are <u><b>not required</b></u> to physically report to their posted secondary school on the next working day following the release of S1 Posting Results. Therefore, we will be posting all the necessary information here to communicate with you and your parents on details for the start of term. Our school will also be engaging parents on 22 December 2022, 9.00 am to 10.30 am via a webinar by our Principal and Year Head (Lower Secondary). The link to access the webinar will be posted on Parents Gateway.

  

<b>Important to note:</b> As our school is a Full Subject Based Banding (FSBB) school in 2023, all Secondary One students will not be assigned to classes based on traditional streams i.e. Express/ Normal Academic/ Normal Technical but will be mixed to allow for better social mixing.
