### Tips for Parents

<b>Setting a clear goal and work towards it</b>

Your child will be sitting for the MTL exam in May/June before he/she sits for the papers of all remaining subjects in October and November. If your child is able to do well for the MTL paper in May/June, your child will have one less subject to focus on— and worry about— in the second half of the year. Your child can then have more time, both during and after school hours, to study other subjects. Doing well for the first ‘O’ Level exam and securing a distinction would also boost your child’s morale and build the momentum towards getting more good grades at the end of the year. It is thus crucial to encourage your child to give his/her all to achieve the best possible grade for the first MTL paper.  
  
Ask your child to think of the MTL grade that he/she would want to achieve and ensure he/she work towards it now.

<b>Focus on becoming a confident speaker</b> 

Encourage your child to seize every opportunity to converse in his/her MTL, particularly for students who are from an English speaking background. Conversing in Mother Tongue Language on a daily basis will help your child build confidence over time and aids in the expression of ideas your child may have in his/her mind without having to translate consciously from the English language. Becoming a competent speaker will reap huge potential benefits considering the oral component alone makes up 25% of the assessment weighting in ‘O’ level exam. In other words, if your child speaks well in his/her MTL, your child is definitely in a much better position to do well and excel in the subject.

<b>Increase Frequency of Language Usage and Exposure</b>

Intensity of language learning and frequency of language usage are two important keys to becoming proficient and competent in a language. Just relying on three to four MTL lessons (which is barely four hours) per week in school may not be sufficient to help your child secure his/her desired grade. Your child will have to help himself/herself by committing to learning the language outside curriculum hours. The following strategies should yield tangible results in a few months’ time if they are strictly adhered to in a consistent manner:  
  
<b>1\. Cultivate a reading habit.</b>If your child is not able to read a book, do ensure he/she reads at least two essays and two comprehension passages every day. Have your child highlight the words and phrases which they think may be useful when writing essays.  
  
<b>2\. Listen to half an hour of news everyday.</b>Encourage your child to read the subtitles (in the relevant MTL) if they are available as your child listens to the news. It will not only help your child improve his/her listening skills and increase his/her general knowledge, providing essays with more substance and depth, it will also help your child recognize more words and improve your child’s grammar.  
  
<b>3\. Watching appropriate TV programmes, reading newspapers, and magazines</b>&nbsp;during leisure time is perfectly fine and is in fact encouraged as long as the contents are suitable for your child’s age and your child knows how to manage his/her time well. When your child comes across an idiom or well written phrase which is inspiring, have your child write it down in his/her notebook and refer to the list from time to time.  

<b>4.&nbsp;Carry a pocket dictionary or have a dictionary app with you.</b>&nbsp;Encourage your child to check out the meaning of words immediately as your child encounters them, and while the context in which the unfamiliar words are being used is still fresh in his/her memory.  

<b>5.</b>&nbsp;Encourage your child to refrain from mixing vocabulary from different languages when speaking. Your child should only do that if it is a deliberate attempt to explain the meaning of certain words. Otherwise, your child should make a conscious&nbsp;<b>effort to speak proper and unadulterated MTL.</b>  
  
Have your child think again of the MTL grade that he/she would want to eventually achieve. Consistency is key. Have your child&nbsp;<b>start to work towards it. Now.</b>


### Our  Philosophy and Belief in Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Education

“*If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his own language, that goes to his heart*.”
 ‒ Nelson Mandela
 
Bedok South’s MTL department believes that a strong foundation in MTL is essential in giving our students a head start for the future workplace and deepening their roots in their culture. With an increasingly globalised workplace, it is important that our students are bilingual and be able to work well in teams of different ethnicities and nationalities. Being able to work well goes beyond just being able to speak the language. It also means having a deep understanding of one’s culture and an inclusive mindset to forge a mutual understanding of each other’s cultures and practices.

Through interactive, authentic and meaningful learning experiences, we aim to nurture our students to be confident communicators of their MTLs, rooted to their culture, open to the world.

### The BDS Experience
Student Outcomes and Approach to BDS MTL Education
*Bilingualism is a cornerstone of our education system to help students remain connected to their heritage, strengthen their Singaporean identity and connect with native-speaking communities worldwide. *
 ‒ Ministry of Education (MOE)

Taking guidance from MOE’s bilingualism policy and the [2021 MTL Syllabus (Secondary)](https://www.moe.gov.sg/-/media/files/secondary/syllabuses/mtl/2021-secondary-mtl-syllabus.pdf), Bedok South’s MTL Curriculum aims to develop students to be active learners, confident communicators and proud ambassadors of their own Mother Tongue Languages and cultures, through:
●	Authentic
●	Interactive and 
●	Quality learning experiences [Quality entails well-designed lessons with rigour and elements of fun and engagement]
Learning MTL effectively requires the support of stakeholders. To support our students, BDS is committed to work closely with parents and communities to create an authentic and conducive environment where students can see meaning, as well as experience joy and success in learning their MTL. 
Some Pedagogies and Strategies we adopt to improve lesson designs and build strong language foundations for students:
●	Differentiated Teaching with banded groups, to cater to students’ various needs.
●	Infusion of ICT in teaching and learning, to achieve higher engagement levels.
●	Emphasis on Formative Assessment, to provide regular feedback.
BDS MTL Programmes

Mother Tongue Fortnight 2023

In support of MOE's efforts to promote student learning and appreciation of Mother Tongue Languages and cultures, our BDS MT Department has organized our Mother Tongue Fortnight (MTFN) in Term 2 Week 2 and Week 3 (27 March – 6 April 2023). Our students participated in various fun and meaningful activities within and outside curriculum time to encourage them to use their MTL and deepen their sense of belonging and rootedness.

As part of our BDS Mother Tongue Talent Development programme, selected students who display interest and aptitude in learning Mother Tongue are given opportunities to participate in activities with authentic settings. These exposures deepen the learning of Mother Tongue Language and provide students with stronger greater understanding and appreciation of their cultural roots. As shown in the photo above, as part of our Mother Tongue Fortnight activities, our Sec 3 Higher Chinese students went through the Student Docent Training program (Photo 1) and facilitated the learning journey of their Sec 3 school peers when they visited Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall (Photo 2) in March.
