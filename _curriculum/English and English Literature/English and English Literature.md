English and English Literature
==============================

### Introduction

The BDS English and Literature in English curriculum aims to provide students with the opportunity to acquire literary and linguistic skills so that they will be able to communicate effectively as a result of their development in the various areas of language competency.

The department curates texts and resources which are diverse to enable our students to explore their own and others’ customs, traditions, values, beliefs and ways of seeing and making sense of the world through readings and discussions. The resources used by the department add to the relevance and authenticity of the curriculum, allowing students to experience the power of language.

Student will

*   acquire communication and collaborative skills
*   develop critical thinking skills
*   have a global awareness
*   find opportunities in class to be creative and innovative
*   be introduced to media literacy

### Approach &amp; Pedagogy

The BDS English Language and Literature programme approaches the teaching of texts thematically in alignment with the Instructional Materials from Curriculum Planning &amp; Development Division (CPDD), with the intentional use of CLEARR pedagogical strategies to encourage exploration of ideas, reflection, and greater focus on the writing journey rather than just the end product. Our lessons are designed based on the principles of e-pedagogy and blended learning and the principles and processes of EL teaching and learning. Teachers facilitate Assessment for Learning (AfL) in classrooms to identify students’ readiness, interests and learning profiles and check their progress. Our teachers adapt the instructional strategies to develop students with different strengths and needs.
