The 3rd edition of Bedok Challenge on 12 August 2016 provides a platform for the youths from Bedok Green Secondary, Bedok North Secondary, Bedok South Secondary and Bedok View Secondary to be involved in a Sports Competition amongst one another. The students competed in Floorball, Captainball and Ultimate Frisbee and also got to learn to play a new game in Kinball. The objective is to encourage and inspire the youths in this Challenge to lead an active and healthy lifestyle.

This event was opened to Lower Secondary Students who are in the Overweight and/or Underweight category defined in the School Cockpit and certified fit under the School Health Services.
Our school emerged as the overall champion amongst the four schools and won the Challenge Trophy in this event which was held at Bedok View Secondary School. Our students achieved this by winning the Ultimate Frisbee Girls and Boys Competitions and the Floorball Girls and Boys Competitions.

In all, the students not only had a fun time playing in the competitions, they also made new friends from other schools in the Bedok Challenge.
