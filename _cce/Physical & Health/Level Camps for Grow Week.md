Level Camps for "Grow Week"
===========================

For the first time, BDS embarked on a coordinated school-wide programme where all levels went through 3 days of camp throughout Singapore in the second week of Term 1 from 13-15 Jan. The Sec 1s had Camp Unity which was an orientation camp while the Sec 2s had Camp Challenge, an
adventure camp at Jalan Bahtera Outdoor Adventure Learning Centre. As for the Sec 3s, they had Camp Endeavour with expeditions taking them to various parts of the island. The Sec 4s and 5s had ‘Camp Success’ which was a personal development programme to prepare for their national examinations ahead.

**Sec 1 Camp Unity:**

Camp Unity was a 3-day 2-night residential camp programme conducted in school. About 275 Sec 1 students attended this camp along with 30 Sec 2 prefects and peer leaders who helped to organise the camp. Their form teachers stayed with them throughout the camp, strengthening bonds with their form classes. Students participated in activities that developed their class spirit and identity. The highlight of the camp was the campfire where a huge screen was constructed at the quadrangle displaying the amazing campfire.

**Sec 2 Camp Challenge:**

Camp Resilience was conducted at Jalan Bahtera located at the western end of Singapore. There they participated in adventure activities like abseiling, high and low ropes courses, caving and an expedition to Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve. The students were placed outside their comfort zone and they had to overcome the individual and group challenges placed before them. They were led also by Sec 3 prefects and peer leaders in the activities.

**Sec 3 Camp Endeavour:**

Camp Endeavour was a series of three expeditions. The first was a 8km long orienteering trail at Pasir Ris Park. Students get to practise their navigation skills. The second was a 11km trail around MacRitchie Reservoir where the students navigated themselves around the Nature Reserve of MacRitchie Reservoir, the Central Catchment Area and the Tree Top Walk. The third expedition was the Southern Ridges Trail which was about 12km long. There they walked up and down Telok Blangah Hill, Mt Faber and crossed the beautiful Henderson Waves Bridge ending the hike at HortPark.

**Sec 4 Camp Success:**

Camp Success had the Sec 4s and 5s undergoing training sessions to develop their time management skills and life skills needed to chart their future. They had courses in resume writing and interview skills to help prepare them for their future. They also had sessions where they discover and explore their future education and careers.

Overall the camps marked a good start for each of the levels. These set a good tone and signalled a good start for the year ahead for all.
