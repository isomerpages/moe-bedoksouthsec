<h3>Mathematics Learning Journeys &amp; Learning Experiences</h3>
<p>In our effort towards student-centric, values-driven education, we want
to nurture engaged learners who are motivated and enjoy learning. One of
the areas to make every student an engaged learner is to ignite the joy
of learning. This can be achieved in many means. We chose Experiential
Learning.</p>
<p>Learning Journeys and Learning Experiences are designed for students to
have the opportunities to apply knowledge and skills learnt in class in
real-life contexts. We have evolved to integrate more subjects into these
learning journeys.</p>
<p>Through these learning experiences, our students learn to realise the
relevance of their lessons in school and have developed renewed enthusiasm
and drive to greater achievement in school. Through this all, our students
see meaningful learning of Mathematics and Problem solving in the real
world.</p>

<p><strong>Learning Journey to Sports Hub Museum</strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

<p>Our BDSians had an engaging hands-on learning experience as they applied
mathematical concepts to real-world sports scenarios at the Sports Hub
Museum. The learning journey began with students measuring their brisk
walking times and calculating their speeds, comparing their results to
professional athletes by using percentage differences and ratio calculations.
This practical approach allowed them to understand how math can be used
to measure and evaluate performance in sports.</p>
<p>Next, using a floorball stick, the students participated in an activity
to measure the ratio of successful attempts, providing them with a deeper
understanding of probability and the significance of repeated trials in
sports. By applying these mathematical principles, they not only gained
insight into how athletes measure their own performance but also explored
the concept of consistency and how it impacts overall success in sports.</p>

</div>
<p>The experience didn’t stop there; students also engaged in mathematical
investigations where they analysed historical sports data to identify trends
and patterns in athletic performance. They examined how various factors,
such as training techniques and advancements in equipment, have contributed
to improvements in performance over time. By visualising their findings
through graphs and charts, they learned how to interpret data in a way
that can drive conclusions and inform decision-making in sports science.</p>
<p>This interactive and multi-faceted approach not only made learning math
fun but also demonstrated the crucial role mathematics plays in understanding
and advancing sports performance. Students saw firsthand how mathematical
skills are essential tools in analysing, improving, and optimizing athletic
abilities, while also reinforcing teamwork, critical thinking, and data
analysis skills.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Journey to URA Centre</strong>

<p>Our Secondary 3NT students embarked on an enlightening Learning Journey
to the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) of Singapore, immersing themselves
in a lesson enriched with map scales, statistical diagrams, population
comparisons, and 3D objects.</p>
<p>Engaging in hands-on activities, they skillfully wielded the 'Measure'
app on their iPads and interacted with dynamic displays, unraveling the
complexities of map representation and scale manipulation.</p>
<p>Leveraging on the use of Classkick, students instantly verified their
answers and received constructive feedback, enhancing their methodological
prowess. This immersive educational experience bestows upon them not just
mathematical proficiency but also a profound appreciation for the practical
applications of Mathematics in the real world.</p>

<h3>ICAN</h3>
<p>In reaching out to the under-achievers in a Mathematics class, the ICAN
principles were adopted this year in the Normal Technical and Normal Academic
classes to better meet these students’ needs.</p>
<p>Using the 8 Principles as a guide, the teacher carefully designs his/
her teaching package to deliver a more effective lesson. The lesson may
comprise of good learning experiences such as the use of manipulatives
and focus on a real-life context.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The unique feature of the ICAN framework is the mentoring aspect. The
mentor who is assigned to the teacher will provide feedback on the lesson
design, sits in for the lesson observation and conducts the post lesson
conference. During the post lesson conference, students’ learning gaps
or misconceptions that were observed would be discussed further.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although this project requires massive manpower and careful deployment,
it has been worthwhile as both the teachers and students have benefitted
much from it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students’ feedback on the lessons was encouraging while teachers felt
that they became more reflective and effective in delivering a good lesson.&nbsp;</p>
