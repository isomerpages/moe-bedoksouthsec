<p>The National Civil Defence Cadet Corps (NCDCC) was formed in 2005 and
the creation of this Uniformed Group was in response to the need for the
young leaders of tomorrow to have a firm pillar and grounding in Total
Defence. NCDCC is a component of the Home Team Cadet Corps Initiative and
has their Headquarters located at the Home Team Academy. The NCDCC Crest
closely follows the crest of the parent organisation, Singapore Civil Defence
Force (SCDF). The international Civil Defence triangle features prominently
in the crest. The equilateral blue triangle symbolizes the three main areas
of Civil Defence — fire safety, first aid, and rescue and evacuation.</p>

<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>In alignment with the aims of our HQ NCDCC and our parent organisation
SCDF, NCDCC seeks to nurture and develop our youths into resilient and
responsible citizens through innovative and challenging CD activities.
It is a choice Uniformed Group (UG) that equips our youths with life-savings
skills for challenging times ahead.</p>
<h3>Scope of Activities</h3>
<p>NCDCC believes in developing and empowering its cadets to become active
and concerned citizens with life-saving skills such as basic firefighting,
first aid, CPR and AED.</p>
<p>In 2017, NCDCC launched the Specialisation Model to better train and equip
cadets with relevant civil defence skills. Under the Specialisation Model,
the Secondary 3 cadets are given the choice to specialise in any one of
the three tracks – Fire Safety, Medical Support and Urban Search and Rescue.
They are encouraged to pursue development in their areas of interest and
strengths so that they can prepare themselves to serve the needs of the
community.</p>
<p>In the light of the rising threat of terrorism, Singapore has launched
the SGSecure Movement as a community response to the terror threat. The
NCDCC cadets play a crucial role in actively advocating for greater knowledge
of life-saving skills. Through the course of the year, our cadets have
participated in many events and competitions such as Precision Drill Challenge,
Urban Adventure Civil Defence Challenge (UACDC), Tampines West Community
Resilience Day 2023, NCDCC Affirmation Day, NCDCC Parade 2023 and National
Day Parade 2023. All these have helped in the development of our cadets’
leadership skills, civil defence knowledge and also forged stronger bonds
amongst them.</p>
