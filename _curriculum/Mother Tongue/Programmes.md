### Mother Tongue Language Fortnight

As part of the school's effort to create a vibrant environment that encourages students to learn more about their Mother Tongue Languages, the MTL Department has been holding the MTL Fortnight on an annual basis. During the MTL Fortnight, a wide range of activities (including quizzes, riddles, a singing competition, creative essay writing competition and various cultural related workshops including cooking and traditional food tasting, seal carving, fan painting, and lantern making) would be organized to encourage students to use more of their Mother Tongue Languages, and help students gain more exposure to their respective cultures.

### Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme (CPES)

Through the Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme (CPES), which was an initiative introduced by the Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning (CPCLL), the school aims to expose students to various Chinese language-related cultural performances (eg. Cross-Talk Performances, Dramas, Theatrical Plays) by local and foreign performing arts groups every year. Students are free to sign up for performances which appeal to them when a performance becomes available. After each performance, students will pen a reflection (in Chinese Language) on what they have learned and the teacher will discuss some of the learning points with the class.
