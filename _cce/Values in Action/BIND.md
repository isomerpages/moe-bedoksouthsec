#### BDS INTERNATIONALISATION AND NATIONAL EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT (BIND) PROGRAMME: SECONDARY 3 OVERSEAS LEARNING JOURNEY

The objectives of our BIND-West Malaysia Programme are to: 
* develop in our students a global outlook
* appreciate and better understand other cultures
* enhance studentsâ€™ interpersonal relationships with their own classmates, peers and teachers

Students will also be doing their Community Involvement Programme (CIP) with/for our overseas partners developing them a deeper empathy for others. And helping them see how fortunate we are in Singapore and that help is not just restricted to within our borders. 

Students involvement in Community & Environment Programmes
