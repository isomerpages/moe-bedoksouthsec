<p>It is advised for students to purchase one set of full uniform (school
uniform, tie, school pants/skirt), two school pants/skirts, and two OneBDS
2<sup>nd </sup>Uniform Polo T-shirts. Students are strongly encouraged
to purchase two OneBDS 2<sup>nd</sup> Uniform Polo T-shirt as it is the
schoolâ€™s 2<sup>nd</sup> uniform attire, and students would usually prefer
to wear the Polo T-shirt instead of the full uniform due to the warm weather.
<br><em>Please be informed that the OneBDS 2<sup>nd</sup> Uniform Polo T-shirt is <u>not allowed</u> to be used as a PE attire as they serve different functionality and purpose. &nbsp;</em>
