Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB)
=================================

Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) is part of MOEâ€™s ongoing efforts to nurture the joy of learning and develop multiple pathways to cater to the different strengths and interests of our students.

With Full SBB, we are moving towards a secondary school education where students learn each subject at the level that best caters to their overall strengths, interests and learning needs.

Full SBB aims for students to:
<br>1\. Have greater ownership of their learning according to their strengths, interests, abilities, talents and learning needs
<br>2\. Develop a **growth mindset and an intrinsic motivation** to learn for life
<br>3\. Have **more opportunities to interact with friends** of different strengths, interests, abilities and talents
<br>4\. Have **more options for post-secondary pathways**, while ensuring they have strong fundamentals and can thrive in their chosen pathway

Thus, students who go through Full SBB will experience:
* Mixed form classes upon entering secondary school
* Greater flexibility to offer subjects at various subject levels
* Shift away from stream-based subject offerings     

**Common Curriculum Subjects**

Students will take **six common curriculum subjects** with peers from their form class. These subjects are Art, Character &amp; Citizenship Education, Design &amp; Technology, Food &amp; Consumer Education, Music and Physical Education. These subjects take up approximately one-third of curriculum time, giving students time to interact with classmates of different strengths and interests.

For other subjects, students can take them at **different subject levels (i.e. G1/ NT, G2/ NA or G3/ Express)** according to their strengths, interests and learning needs.

Eligible students can take some subjects at a **more or less demanding level** at appropriate junctures. School will advise students accordingly based on holistic considerations.
