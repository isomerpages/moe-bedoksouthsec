and resourceful cadets to become successful citizens. It takes a structured
approach towards the leadership development of its cadets. Through the
numerous leadership courses and programmes organised by the CCA and HQ
NCC, the cadet is able to hone his abilities and nurture his leadership
potential.</p>

<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>The Singapore National Cadet Corps is a world-class organization that
nurtures responsible, resilient and resourceful cadets to become successful
citizens.</p>
<p>We are a thinking and learning team driven by our Core Values.</p>
<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The NCC's mission is to develop resourceful, responsible, resilient, loyal
leaders and team players through fun and challenging military-related activities.</p>
<h3>Scope of Activities</h3>
<p>The NCC seeks to develop its cadets in a holistic manner, thus providing
many opportunities for its cadets to be involved in Service Learning Projects
and independently-run training sessions. Senior Cadet Leaders (Sec 4/5),
Cadet Leaders (Sec 3) and Student Leaders of any level are given the chance
to hone their abilities and shine through rigorous and fun training sessions.
NCC cadets are given the option of learning military skills in visits to
the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), exposing them to the newly developed
3G SAF training environment. NCC Cadets are also given the opportunity
to participate in the prestigious International Cadet Exchange Programme
(ICEP), where they can go to various countries, such as Australia (Exercise
Wallaby), New Zealand (Exercise Thunder Warrior) and India (Desert Trekking).
There are also many other adventure events, expeditions and courses to
attend, where cadets will earn badges for their outstanding performance
and attendance. These experiences have definitely shaped NCC cadets to
be more global in thinking. Furthermore, they have generated more ideas
for implementing the independently-run training sessions.</p>
<h3>Achievements</h3>
<p>Our consistency in delivering results at the highest levels is a testament
to BDS NCCâ€™s passion and dedication. BDS NCC cadets are chosen for prestigious
opportunities such as the India Trekking Expedition and International Cadet
Exchange Programmes every year.</p>
