Elements of Business Skills
===========================
The Elements of Business Skills (EBS) syllabus is designed as an introduction to business concepts by understanding business activities, focusing on basic marketing and customer relations, in Singapore’s context. Students will have opportunities to acquire foundational business knowledge and develop transferable employability skills in the service industry, namely the Travel and Tourism, Hospitality and Retail industries.

  

The service industry continues to play a significant role in Singapore’s economic growth and offers employment opportunities. With globalisation, changing demographics and technological advancement, businesses are innovating and reinventing themselves to stay ahead of the competition. The study of EBS in the selected industries would provide students with opportunities to learn and develop 21st Century Competencies (Figure 1.1) needed to thrive in an increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous world.

The syllabus provides students with the foundation for further studies at institutes of higher learning. Through this course of study, students become aware of the prospects and challenges of a career in the services sector.

It is offered as an elective subject at Secondary Three and examinable at the GCE Normal (Technical) Level.
